Omitted Variables

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Omitted variables and endogeneity have traditionally not been major concerns
 in S2S or small area estimation.
 This is because, in the current period, any omitted variables are accounted
 for by the constant term, which adjusts to ensure that OLS predictions
 of the dependent variable remain unbiased.
 However, over time, the effects of omitted variables can influence predictions
 considerably.
 For a more detailed discussion, see the annex (Annex 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "subsec:ann_ovb"
plural "false"

\end_inset

).

.
 The authors presume that the decrease in poverty predicted in rural areas
 is driven by a reduction in conflict.
 The models do not control for conflict.
 Additionally, the authors follow recommendations of the SWIFT program and
 include 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

fast-changing consumption variables to better capture welfare changes during
 shocks
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt

\end_inset

, p6).
 Among the variables the authors include to the model are a list of food
 consumption dummies that include meat, eggs, and chocolate.
 However, it is quite likely that the model used by the authors suffers
 from omitted variable bias.
 Mainly, conflict is likely negatively correlated to expenditure and is
 also likely to be negatively correlated to these consumption dummies as
 it may affect the availability of these goods.
 The discussion in the annex (Annex 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:ann_ovb"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) illustrates that in this case, the omission of conflict from the model
 is likely to lead to biased estimates of poverty due to omitted variable
 bias (OVB).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To simulate the potential impact of omitted variable bias on poverty predictions
 over time the data simulated in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Creating-populations"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 is expanded to include 2 new covariates: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Conflict.
 Conflict is assumed to be negatively correlated with welfare with a coefficient
 equal to -0.3.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
It is simulated as a binary variable taking value 1 when a random uniform
 number between 0 and 1 is less than 
\begin_inset Formula $c=0.4$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Eggs purchased.
 The variable is assumed to be positively correlated to welfare with a coefficie
nt equal to 0.4.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
It is simulated as a binary variable taking value 1 when a random uniform
 number between 0 and 1 is less than 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(0.5x+0.5Conflict\right)$
\end_inset

, with 
\begin_inset Formula $x=1$
\end_inset

 in the baseline.
 The DGP for the covariate illustrates the negative correlation of conflict
 and the likelihood of purchasing eggs.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Under the baseline simulation, the value for 
\begin_inset Formula $x=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c=0.4$
\end_inset

.
 Welfare is simulated assuming the true DGP, and thus includes conflict
 and eggs with their true coefficients.
 The prediction model is produced omitting conflict and is executed using
 the complete data to avoid other potential sources of bias (Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Omitted-variable-model"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 As presented in Annex 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:ann_ovb"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the coefficient on eggs is upward biased.
 Due to the omission of conflict, the constant term of the regression is
 downward biased.
 The adjustment in the constant term ensures that the model's prediction
 of the dependent variable is unbiased.
 As can be seen, omitting conflict from the model also leads to a larger
 RMSE, which will likely affect poverty predictions over time.
 Nevertheless, for predictions to the same period OVB has little if any
 impact (

plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The reason for this is that even in the presence of OVB 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{var}\left[x\hat{\beta}\right]+\hat{\sigma}_{e}^{2}$

 will be the same to the one where conflict is present and since 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{y}$

 with added covariates.
 Predictions are assessed at various poverty lines across the welfare distributi

\begin_layout Standard
For the simulation, different values of 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 are determined, which yield a change in conflict likelihood and egg purchases.
 No other covariate is changed.
 Using the adjusted covariates, the true resulting welfare is calculated
 – including conflict and the correct coefficients.
 Then the model parameters obtained from the original data, excluding conflict,
 is used to obtain predictions of poverty across the welfare distribution.
 As can be seen in the discussion in the Annex 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:ann_ovb"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the direction of the prediction bias is not immediately clear.
 In many instances the predictions will suggest an increase in poverty whereas
 in reality poverty has dropped.
 In other instances it may underestimate the total change.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Under the assumed data-generating process (DGP), imagine that conflict decreases
 by 50% (
\begin_inset Formula $c=0.2$
\end_inset

), and egg purchases decline by 30% (
\begin_inset Formula $x=$
\end_inset

0.7) due to factors unrelated to conflict.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Note that because of the relationship to conflict egg purchases do not actually
 drop by 30% since it is offset by the decrease in conflict.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 In such a case, S2S predictions over time would likely show an increase
 in poverty based on most thresholds.
 However, in reality, poverty would have actually decreased (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 This is just an illustrative example where the purpose is to illustrate
 the potential problems encountered when imputing over time, particularly
 in instances that a major shock has occurred in between the year of the
 actual welfare data and the target data.
 The inclusion of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

fast-changing

 consumption variables as covariates is likely to introduce OVB to prediction
 models for imputations to other periods unless the shock only affects welfare
 but not individual components of welfare.

 Predictions are assessed at various poverty lines across the welfare distributi

 Specifically, these lines correspond to percentiles that are multiples

The impact of omitted variable bias extends beyond “fast-changing” consumption
 variables.
 Consider a model that includes an indicator for subsistence farmers, who
 are more likely to be poor and thus negatively correlated with welfare.
 Now imagine a massive drought occurs between the year the model was trained
 and the target year.
 This drought could reduce the number of people farming.
 If those former farmers are unable to meet their needs, the model might
 underestimate poverty because it omitted the effect of the drought.
 Another example involves the omission of remittances which are positively
 related to welfare and likely positively related to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fast-changing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 consumption variables, such as eggs or meat.
 Under this instance the coefficient on eggs would be upward biased, and
 since the impact of the omitted variable will be absorbed by the intercept
 it will likely also be upward biased.
 Thus, changes in remittances that are not captured by the model are likely
 to lead to biased predictions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The magnitude and direction of the bias that arises due to OVB is often
 not clear and could compound other biases just as easily as it could be
 offset by other biases.
 Nevertheless, unless actual welfare data are available for the imputed
 year it is impossible to truly know how the model is performing.

 decreased conflict.

Note that nothing to control for those shocks was included in the original
 model.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 However, since conflict is not explicitly included in their model, its
 effects would only manifest through changes in other variables.
 This potential omitted variable bias raises concerns about the model's
 reliability for temporal predictions.
 When imputing over time, it is possible for multiple issues to arise.
 Since true expenditure is not available it is impossible to know if the
 model's biases cancel eachother out or compound.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A key aspect of the team's imputation is the inclusion of fast changing
 consumption variables, such as an indicator of whether or not the household
 consumed eggs over the past week.

 Nevertheless, these variables are likely subject to omitted variable bias
 which can lead to biased estimates of the coefficients leading to biased
 poverty measures.
 In the case of the Afghanistan imputation the omitted variable is conflict.
 In others it may be the introduction of a cash transfer, for example.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If conflict is negatively related to expenditure and negatively related
 to consumption of certain goods, such as meat and eggs, this would lead
 to coefficients that are upward biased.
 Assume the following, simplified, model:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Y=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}Eggs+\beta_{2}Conflict+\varepsilon\label{eq:full_egg_conflict}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By omitting conflict the model is now:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Y=\tilde{\beta}_{0}+\tilde{\beta}_{1}Eggs+u\label{eq:fit_egg_conflict}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $u=\beta_{2}Conflict+\varepsilon$
\end_inset

.
 In a model where conflict is not included 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\beta}_{1}$
\end_inset

would be greater than 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 The OLS estimator for 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\beta}_{1}$
\end_inset

 is given by:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\tilde{\beta}_{1}=\frac{\mathrm{Cov}\left(Eggs,Y\right)}{\mathrm{Var}\left[Eggs\right]}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\tilde{\beta}_{1}=\frac{\mathrm{Cov}\left(Eggs,\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}Eggs+\beta_{2}Conflict+\varepsilon\right)}{\mathrm{Var}\left[Eggs\right]}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and relying on the linearity of covariance:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\tilde{\beta}_{1}=\beta_{1}+\frac{\beta_{2}\mathrm{Cov}\left(Eggs,Conflict\right)}{\mathrm{Var}\left[Eggs\right]}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since we assume that conflict and welfare are negatively correlated, and
 negatively correlated with the likelihood of buying eggs, then we know
 that 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{2}<0$
\end_inset

 and that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{Cov}\left(Eggs,Conflict\right)<0$
\end_inset

.
 This would lead to 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\beta_{2}\mathrm{Cov}\left(Eggs,Conflict\right)}{\mathrm{Var}\left[Eggs\right]}>0$
\end_inset

 which means that 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\beta}_{1}$
\end_inset

 is upward biased.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, the intercept will be underestimated.
 The intercept is equal to:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\tilde{\beta}_{0}=\bar{y}-\tilde{\beta}_{1}\overline{Eggs}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\tilde{\beta}_{0}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}\overline{Eggs}+\beta_{2}\overline{Conflict}-\tilde{\beta}_{1}\overline{Eggs}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\tilde{\beta}_{0}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{2}\overline{Conflict}+(\beta_{1}-\tilde{\beta}_{1})\overline{Eggs}\label{eq:intercept}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
we know that 
\begin_inset Formula $\grave{\beta_{2}<0,}$
\end_inset

 and that 
\begin_inset Formula $(\beta_{1}-\tilde{\beta}_{1})<0.$
\end_inset

 This suggest that the intercept term is downward biased.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When predicting over time, the direction of the prediction bias is dictated
 by changes in conflict and the share of households who purchased eggs.
 Any change in conflict, will lead to a change in egg purchases and expenditure.
 The direction of the bias in prediction is undetermined:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E\left[\bar{\tilde{y}}-\bar{y}\right]=E\left[\tilde{\beta}_{0}+\tilde{\beta}_{1}\overline{Eggs}'-\beta_{0}-\beta_{1}\overline{Eggs}'-\beta_{2}\overline{Conflict'}\right]
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

and downward biased if:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula

and while they could cancel eachother out, it is unlikely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that since poverty also depends on the model's predicted root mean
 squared error (
\begin_inset Formula $RMSE$
\end_inset

), which would change over time since it is a function of the omitted variable
 – conflict – then there are 2 sources of bias.
 The first is due to the egg coefficient and the intercept, and the second
 is due to the difference in the distribution of errors which changes due
 to the omitted variable.
 A decrease in conflict would potentially lead to a shrinking of the 
\begin_inset Formula $RMSE$
\end_inset

, lowering the poverty likelihood of households but would be ignored in
 the Afghanistan exercise.le populations.
