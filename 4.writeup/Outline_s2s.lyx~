Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The measurement and monitoring of poverty are central to assessing global
 development progress.
 For the World Bank, whose twin goals include ending extreme poverty, the
 ability to track poverty reduction is fundamental to measuring institutional
 effectiveness and guiding policy decisions.
 Yet a persistent challenge hampers this crucial task: the limited availability
 of recent, high-quality household survey data.
 This challenge is particularly acute in countries where poverty is concentrated
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "DangJolliffeCarletto"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 For instance, India, home to a significant share of the global poor, did
 not release official consumption survey data between 2011 and 2022.
 Similarly, Nigeria lacked household survey data for poverty monitoring
 between 2009 and 2018.
 These data gaps not only affect our understanding of poverty at the country
 level but can significantly impact global poverty estimates and our assessment
 of progress toward poverty reduction targets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Traditional poverty measurement relies on household surveys that collect
 detailed consumption or income data.
 These surveys represent substantial investments in both financial and human
 resources.
 They require extensive preparation, careful implementation, and place considera
ble burden on responding households, who must either maintain detailed consumpti
on diaries or participate in comprehensive recall interviews.
 The method of data collection itself can introduce significant biases into
 poverty estimates.
 For instance, consumption diaries – while theoretically more accurate –
 can lead to respondent fatigue and underreporting over time.
 Recall modules, on the other hand, may suffer from memory bias, with longer
 recall periods typically resulting in lower reported consumption.
 Research has shown that simply changing the recall period or the number
 of consumption items can lead to substantially different poverty estimates
 within the same population (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "beegle2012methods"

\end_inset

).
 These methodological challenges add another layer of complexity to the
 already demanding task of poverty measurement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The challenges of traditional poverty measurement become particularly acute
 during crises when standard survey operations are disrupted or impossible
 to conduct.
 Armed conflicts, natural disasters, health emergencies, and other humanitarian
 crises often prevent face-to-face household interviews precisely when poverty
 monitoring becomes most crucial.
 The COVID-19 pandemic provided a stark illustration of this challenge,
 as household survey efforts were halted globally at a time when understanding
 welfare impacts was most critical.
 Similar data collection constraints arise in conflict zones, where security
 concerns prevent enumerator access to households, or during natural disasters
 that displace populations and disrupt statistical operations.
 During such crises, policymakers and international organizations must resort
 to alternative methods for estimating poverty.
 Survey-to-survey imputation, often combined with rapid phone surveys or
 other alternative data collection methods, has emerged as a key tool for
 maintaining poverty monitoring during these challenging periods.
 However, these approaches come with their own limitations and potential
 biases that must be carefully considered.

 Global projections of poverty rely on GDP projections during the pandemic.
 The GDP projection for each country is used to shift the welfare distribution
 of a given country by the GDP per capita growth rate observed between year
 corresponding to the household survey collection and the desired year in
 the future.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Survey-to-survey (S2S) imputation has emerged as a methodological response
 to these data limitations.
 The approach builds upon techniques originally developed for small area
 estimation (SAE) in poverty mapping, pioneered by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 and further refined by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 S2S imputation enables poverty estimation using surveys that lack direct
 welfare measures by:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Generating poverty estimates based on the predicted welfare distribution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While S2S and small area estimation share methodological foundations, they
 serve distinct purposes.
 Small area estimation, as developed by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "elbers2003micro"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and advanced by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "molina2010small"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, typically applies nationally estimated models to census data to generate
 precise poverty estimates for small geographic areas.
 In contrast, S2S focuses on predicting welfare in a separate survey, regardless
 of geographic disaggregation.
 One might view traditional poverty mapping as a special case of S2S where
 the target dataset are the different areas of the census and the primary
 goal is obtaining geographically disaggregated estimates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This handbook first examines the limitations and potential pitfalls of survey-to
-survey imputation through rigorous analysis of its fundamental assumptions.
 In these experiments, the focus is not on traditional concerns such as
 variable selection or model specification, but rather on the method's core
 limitations, particularly for measuring poverty across extended time periods
 or different populations.
 The analysis relies on simulated data to isolate and demonstrate specific
 mechanisms that can generate biased estimates.
 This approach allows for clear illustration of three critical findings:
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Standard sampling bias-correction techniques, such as re-weighting to match
 population means, may be insufficient when source and target surveys differ
 fundamentally.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The method's tendency to replicate the welfare distribution of the source
 survey makes it unreliable for measuring changes in inequality.
 These insights are particularly relevant given the increasing reliance
 on survey-to-survey imputation to fill data gaps in poverty monitoring.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Third, omitted variable bias will likely affect poverty predictions, particularl
y when imputing across time periods that include significant economic shocks
 or structural changes.
 This last finding has important implications for applications that use
 "fast-moving" variables to capture welfare changes, as these variables
 may introduce bias if they are correlated with unobserved factors that
 affect welfare.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Through systematic examination of these limitations using simplified examples,
 the handbook provides practitioners with a framework for understanding
 when and why S2S methods may produce misleading results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because things with real world data tend to work somewhat differently than
 expected, the handbook then proceeds to validate imputation techniques
 leveraging the Peruvian data.

The results here are of relevance since survey-to-survey imputation has

\begin_layout Section
Survey-to-Survey Imputation in Action
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Survey-to-survey imputation has become a widely used tool for poverty estimation
 when consumption or income data are unavailable.
 The World Bank's Survey of Well-being via Instant and Frequent Tracking
 (SWIFT) program represents a systematic application of this approach, combining
 S2S methods with rapid surveys to generate poverty estimates.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Evidence from country applications has revealed both the potential and limitatio
ns of these methods.
 In Afghanistan, a 2015 implementation failed to capture significant changes
 in poverty rates when using a model trained on 2011 data (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "SwiftMethod"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Similar challenges have emerged in other contexts experiencing rapid economic
 transitions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fundamental challenge lies in the method's core assumptions.
 S2S imputation assumes that model parameters remain stationary over time
 - meaning that any observed changes in poverty are solely attributable
 to changes in the model's covariates, rather than shifts in unobservable
 factors or changing returns to these covariates (Dang, Lanjouw and Serajuddin
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citebyear
key "dang2017"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 This assumption becomes particularly tenuous in dynamic economic contexts.
 As 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "christiaensen2012small"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 note, such assumptions may be especially problematic in rapidly growing
 economies like India, where structural economic changes can alter the relations
hip between poverty and its predictors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Researchers and practitioners have proposed various approaches to address
 these limitations.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "stifel2007tracking"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 advocate for including time-varying variables such as rainfall and prices
 to capture temporal changes.
 In response to experiences like Afghanistan, the SWIFT program has adapted
 its application of S2S by incorporating variables that track economic condition
s more directly 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "SwiftMethod"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 However, as 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "SwiftMethod"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 emphasize, without updated training data to re-estimate model parameters,
 the risk of missing significant economic changes remains substantial, even
 with these additional variables.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The effectiveness of S2S imputation across time has been subject to empirical
 validation across various contexts, revealing both its potential and limitation
s.
 While some studies report estimates within acceptable margins of error,
 others highlight significant discrepancies between predicted and observed
 poverty rates.
 These mixed results underscore the importance of careful consideration
 when applying S2S imputation across different temporal and economic contexts.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bias of estimates obtained with data that correspond to very different
 time periods or data where the covariates are considerably different has
 mostly been studied using real world data.
 For example, Dang, Lanjouw and Serajuddin (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 within margins of error.

 The authors perform survey-to-survey imputation over time in scenarios

 estimate of poverty.
 The authors validate their approach using data for Vietnam and for China
 using rural household panel data.
 In Vietnam, the authors obtain a model using the 1992/93 data and predict
 poverty using the 1997/98 data.
 They note that the method works relatively well and depending on the covariates
 used, differences between predicted and observed poverty rates were on
 average 3.4 percentage points during a period where poverty fell by 23.2
 percentage points.
 For the Chinese regions where the method was tested, the authors also find
 that the methods work relatively well.
 However, depending on the model used differences between predicted and
 observed rates were considerable.

\begin_layout Standard
Applications of survey to survey imputation have also made their way to
 global poverty monitoring.

As of this writing, every poverty number for India after 2011 is an imputation.

 This is mostly due to India's lack of recent survey data.
 The following case studies illustrate specific instances where S2S applications
 have found their way to the World Bank's global poverty numbers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
S2S in India
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
India's importance in global poverty measurement cannot be overstated.
 Its large population implies that even a slight shift in poverty in the
 country can make or break the World Bank's pledge on ending extreme poverty.
 Consequently, since 2011, the last time data was collected before 2022,
 there are at least 3 different studies which attempt to estimate a poverty
 rate for the country making use of survey-to-survey imputation (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "newhouse2019estimating,sinha2022poverty,edochie2022we"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 These papers obtain a welfare model constructed on the 2011 data and apply
 it to several more recent data which lack a welfare measure to obtain poverty
 predictions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 2017, when the next expenditure survey for the country was supposed to
 be released it was scrapped due to concerns regarding its validity.
 There were leaks of the report, however, and these suggested that between

 While rural consumption fell by 8.8 percent, urban areas fared somewhat

 the leaked report never fed into the World Bank's global poverty monitoring

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Various studies utilizing survey-to-survey (S2S) imputation have produced
 divergent estimates of poverty in India, raising questions about the robustness
 of such methods.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

 estimate a dramatic reduction in poverty, from 22.5 percent in 2011/12 to
 12.7 percent in 2014/15, suggesting poverty was nearly halved during this
 period.
 In contrast, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "sinha2022poverty"

\end_inset

 provide a higher poverty estimate for 2015, ranging between 18.6 percent
 and 20.6 percent, while an earlier version of the same paper placed the
 figure at around 15 percent.
 Similarly, estimates for 2017/18 differ: the World Bank's Poverty and Shared
 Prosperity Report (PSPR) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, following 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, provides estimates of poverty at 9.9 percent.
 However, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "sinha2022poverty"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 suggest the poverty rate for 2017 lies between 12.2 and 15.3 percent, with
 a previous version of their work estimating 13 to 14 percent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A common feature across these imputation exercises is their reliance on
 parameters derived from the 2011 National Sample Survey (NSS), despite
 significant changes in the Indian economy since then.
 This reliance has produced conflicting trends.
 For example, the imputation-based models suggest declining poverty and
 inequality, while data from a leaked, retracted 2017-18 report indicates
 a fall in rural consumption across all deciles of the welfare distribution,
 with higher declines among wealthier groups.
 This discrepancy underscores the limitations of imputation-based approaches
 when direct data is unavailable, leaving critical questions about the accuracy
 and reliability of poverty estimates unanswered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other authors have attempted to arrive at a poverty rate for India leading

 very elaborate statistical applications poverty numbers are presented with
 statements of precision that may be misleading.

S2S in Afghanistan
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Afghanistan's 2023 poverty estimates, derived through survey-to-survey (S2S)
 imputation, illustrate the complexities of applying this methodology during
 periods of significant economic transition.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

 trained their model using the 2019-2020 Expenditure and Labor Force Survey
 (IE-LFS), which reported a national poverty rate of 52.3 percent, and applied
 it to 2023 phone survey data to estimate updated poverty rates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The estimates indicate a decline in poverty to 48.3 percent in 2023, driven
 by reductions in rural poverty despite slight increases in urban areas.
 While these results are noteworthy, several methodological and contextual
 factors warrant caution.
 First, the reliance on phone survey data introduces challenges related
 to representativeness.
 The 2023 estimates were based on responses from households in the 2019-20
 IE-LFS with access to phones and who participated in the follow-up survey.
 Although weights were adjusted for socioeconomic characteristics such as
 region, urban/rural status, electricity access, and household assets, such
 adjustments may not fully address potential biases inherent in phone-based
 surveys.
 Experimental evidence (see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Results_simdata"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) demonstrates the risks of bias when using S2S imputation with re-weighted
 data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, the model’s performance metrics raise questions about its predictive
 accuracy.
 Even on the original 2019-20 data used for estimation, model predictions
 deviated by nearly 1 percentage point, indicating potential violations
 of key assumptions (Table 4 of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "barriga2023updating"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 ).
 When applied to 2021 data, the model overestimated urban poverty by 1.7
 percentage points and rural poverty by 2.1 points, suggesting that the reported
 4-percentage-point reduction in 2023 could fall within a margin of error
 rather than representing a clear trend.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Third, broader economic indicators appear inconsistent with the reported
 decline in poverty.
 Between 2019 and 2023, Afghanistan faced significant economic challenges,
 including severe GDP contraction after administrative changes and U.S.
 military withdrawal, droughts exacerbating food insecurity, reductions
 in emergency food assistance, a locust outbreak affecting key agricultural
 areas,

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_layout

\end_inset

 and a doubling of unemployment rates.
 These factors collectively point to heightened vulnerabilities rather than
 improvements in welfare.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The authors attribute the poverty reduction primarily to reduced conflict
 and lower food prices.
 However, the model does not directly account for conflict, leaving this
 explanation speculative.
 Any effects would need to operate indirectly through the model’s existing
 covariates, raising concerns about omitted variable bias that could compromise
 its predictions over time (see Annex 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 for simulation results).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additionally, the model’s reliance on consumption indicators, such as meat
 and egg consumption, introduces further uncertainty.
 Much of the welfare gains in rural areas stem from variables capturing
 these specific consumption patterns, which may be closely tied to conflict
 and other contextual factors.
 For instance, reported meat consumption increased by 30 percent and egg
 consumption doubled, with these variables contributing significantly to
 the estimated rise in real per capita consumption.
 Yet such trends seem incongruous with broader economic realities, underscoring
 the challenges in interpreting these results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In sum, Afghanistan’s 2023 poverty estimates highlight the difficulties
 of using S2S imputation during periods of economic upheaval.
 The case underscores the need for cautious interpretation of imputed results,
 particularly when data collection limitations, methodological assumptions,
 and contextual factors may influence the findings.
 Recognizing these complexities is critical to ensuring the reliability
 of poverty estimates in challenging contexts.

The Case of Zambia
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Zambia’s gap in survey data between 2015 and 2022 presented a challenge
 for monitoring poverty trends.
 Compounding this challenge, the 2022 consumption data is not directly comparabl
e to 2015 data due to differences in survey design.
 While the 2015 survey used a fixed recall period for food consumption,
 the 2022 survey allowed respondents to choose different reference periods
 for reporting quantities and values of consumption.
 This variation in reporting likely undermines the comparability of the
 two datasets, complicating the construction of poverty trends 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "beegle2012methods"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To address this issue, the Zambia team employed survey-to-survey (S2S) imputatio
n to project the 2015 welfare aggregate onto the 2022 data.
 Using this approach, they estimate that international poverty ($2.15 2017
 USD PPP) increased by nearly 4 percentage points between 2015 and 2022,
 rising from 60.8 to 64.4 percent.
 At the same time, inequality, as measured by the Gini index, is predicted
 to have decreased from 55.9 to 51.5, and average consumption fell by 15 percent,
 from $2.97 (2017 PPP) to $2.53 (2017 PPP).
 While these results suggest a worsening of economic conditions, they also
 raise questions about the broader macroeconomic context.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although the imputed estimates indicate declining welfare, Zambia’s GDP
 per capita in constant terms barely changed between 2015 and 2022, recovering
 to its pre-pandemic levels by 2022 and exceeding its 2018 peak by 2023.
 This divergence between household survey-based consumption estimates and
 national accounts data highlights a growing gap to national accounts that
 is not easily explained.
 Literature suggests such gaps may stem from underreporting of incomes in
 surveys

Given the point of the distribution where mean welfare falls on, a drop

 However, if average consumption indeed fell and poverty increased, as the

Additional concerns about the imputation models remain.
 First, the models fit have a surprisingly high 
\begin_inset Formula $R^{2}$
\end_inset

 value – 0.8 for rural, and 0.91 for urban areas.
 Such a high 
\begin_inset Formula $R^{2}$

 The rural model includes as a covariate the natural logarithm of comparable
 meat consumption per adult equivalent, and its square – the coefficients
 for both are positive.

The model for urban areas has an

 The model includes the number of inactive household members, which a priori
 one would expect to be negatively related to consumption, but is positive
 in this case.
 Moreover, the model suggests that between 2015 and 2022 the number of inactive
 members increased by nearly 1 person, from 1.6 to 2.4.
 Beyond the issue of the inactive members, the urban and rural models share
 many of the same limitations.
 Mainly, the high

 For example, in the case of a regression on agricultural yields the variable
 capturing plot sizes may have missing values and these must be imputed
 with the aim of not losing information as well as obtaining a valid estimate
 of the coefficient for the relationship between land and yields.
 Using multiple imputation in this example, as opposed to just the predicted
 land size, is expected to reduce the rate of false positives.

The case of a variable that is entirely missing in the dataset was not considere

 The key difference to small area estimation up to that point was that 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 predicted the variable of interest, consumption, at the household level
 and from that they obtained aggregate statistics based on the prediction

 Nevertheless, earlier examples exist where data from different sources

 Nevertheless, what is innovative of the work from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 is that the authors apply models fit on survey data to the census with
 the goal of replicating the entire consumption distribution and from that

 if one had welfare in the census.
 After refinements by

 in the World Bank.
 The key difference between survey-to-survey imputation and small area estimatio

The implementation of welfare predictions in the target data can follow
 different approaches.
 The traditional method, grounded in the multiple imputation literature,
 generates several welfare vectors to reflect prediction uncertainty.
 This approach follows what was implemented in poverty mapping through the
 PovMap software (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

) and is similar to the methodology used in Stata's multiple imputation
 commands ( 
\family typewriter
mi regress

).
 Under this approach, each imputed welfare vector is generated through a
 three-step process:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sigma_{e}^{2*}\sim\hat{\sigma}_{e0}^{2}\frac{\left(n-K\right)}{\chi_{n-K}^{2*}},

Hence, for each imputed vector, a new

 is drawn and that is used to draw 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta^{*}$

 and a household specific residual, 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{i}^{*}$

 to reducing the prediction mean squared errors (MSE), but as noted by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 the purpose is to minimize the likelihood of false positives, since normally
 the imputed vectors are then used for regression analysis.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An alternative approach, derived from the small area estimation literature,
 treats the source survey as the best representation of the true welfare
 distribution.
 Under this method, parameters estimated from the source survey are applied
 directly to the target data through Monte Carlo simulation.
 For straightforward indicators like poverty rates, practitioners can simply
 apply the asymptotic formula for expected values (Eq.

When imputing across time, practitioners must rely on an error distribution

 A model trained on data from one year may produce biased estimates when

 Using an outdated error distribution can thus produce misleading inequality
 estimates, even when mean predictions appear reasonable.

The typical imputation approach undertaken, at least under the S2S work

 Under the MI approach the parameters estimated on the training data are

 to the target data are drawn from their posterior distributions as illustrated

A word of caution is warranted here and it is related to how noise is estimated.
 When applying MI methods the noise is typically estimated using Rubin's
 rules 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "rubin1987multiple"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Under Rubin's rules the estimated variance is equal to the sum of within-imputa
tion variance, the between imputation variance, and the between imputation
 variance divided by the number of imputations.
 It is important to remember that these methods were developed for regression
 analysis, where a variable with missing observations is imputed and then
 used in a model.
 Rubin's rules are applied here to obtain a valid standard error.
 Estimating the prediction's noise in a similar manner when parameters are
 applied directly risks producing improper imputations.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Standardizing covariates
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The basics of standardizing covariates is simple.
 In principle, from the data where the model is fit (source data)the mean
 and variance of each covariate is known.
 Consequently, covariates in the sample to be imputed (target data) can
 be adjusted so that the mean and variance of the covariates are aligned
 to that of the source data.
 This is what 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "dang2017"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 recommend for making different survey samples more comparable.
 However, a key assumption here is that the covariates follow a normal distribut
ion.
 In tests done by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "dang2017"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 with data from Jordan the method is judged to be valid.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To test the validity of covariate standardization, the same samples detailed
 in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Extracting-samples"

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 are used.
 Note, however, that the covariates here do not follow a normal distribution.
 Covariate standardization is done by adjusting the covariate from the 
\begin_inset Formula $new$
\end_inset

 survey in the following manner:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x_{new}=(x_{new}-\hat{\mu}_{x_{new}})\frac{\hat{\sigma}_{x}}{\hat{\sigma}_{x_{new}}}+\hat{\mu}_{x}

To remove the potential for other sources of bias, instead of refitting
 a model on the sample, the actual values for the coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 and the error distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{e}^{2}$
\end_inset

 are used.
 For each sample, under each population, 100 vectors in the sample are created
 by adding the linear fit to a randomly drawn error term 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{i}\sim N(0,0.5^{2})$
\end_inset

 to every observation.
 Then, poverty and Gini estimates are obtained for each of the 100 created
 vectors using the newly created survey weights or the standardized covariates
 to calculate poverty and Gini for the samples.
 The average value of the 100 Gini and poverty estimates is used as the
 final estimate.
 Bias is calculated for each measure of interest by comparing the estimate
 with the actual value from the population.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If left unadjusted, poverty estimates under the bottom biased samples will
 underestimate poverty across the entire welfare distribution (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:bias_reweight"
plural "false"

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 Attempts to correct the bias via the creation of weights that match the
 means of the model covariates (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Match X
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) do not have any impact on the bias.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Since the weights assume no priors, these are in fact calculated using maximum
 entropy.
 When prior weights are considered the method adjusts the existing weights
 by the smallest possible amount to ensure the constraints match, this is
 known as cross-entropy.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Adjusting weights so that the covariate means and variances match also
 seems to have little impact on the bias (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Match X and var[X]
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 However, adjusting weights so that the mean linear fit of the target data
 matches the average of the linear fit of the model (
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{y}$
\end_inset

) leads to considerably better results (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Match XB and var[XB]
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 Similarly, much better results are achieved by standardizing each covariate
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Standardize each X
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, as well as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Standardizing XB
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The latter achieves a similar result to adjusting weights so that the mean
 of the linear fit and its variance matches that of the training data.
 In principle, both methods are attempting to achieve the same thing.
 The results presented here are related to Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:var pov"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, thus what matters for poverty is not just the mean of the linear fit,
 it is also dependent on the variance of the linear fit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similar performance of the different adjustment methods is observed when
 applying these to top and bottom biased samples (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:bias_reweight-1"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 An interesting outcome in these results is that if the model were only
 judged at the 40th percentile (i.e.
 at a threshold that yields a poverty rate of 40 percent) it would ignore
 the biased nature of the samples.
 For this reason, it is always recommended to check results across the entire
 welfare distribution, like is done here.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The results show that standardizing covariates as suggested by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "dang2017"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 may be just as good or a better approach than reweighting covariates, of
 course this result may not hold under different covariates.
 However, even better results are obtained by standardizing the linear fit
 (
\begin_inset Formula $X\beta)$
\end_inset

.
 Standardizing 
\begin_inset Formula $X\beta$
\end_inset

 yields phenomenal results under both biased samples tested.
 Given that the standardizing relies on normally distributed data, perhaps
 a better option may be achieved from reweighting in other scenarios.

 Re-weighting to match means, as done in an application in India by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "sinha2022poverty"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, still yields biased results.
 Since the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{e}^{2}$
\end_inset

 used are always the true values, one can surmise that the bias from the
 sampling cannot be overcome by simply reweighting the data.
 This also holds true for cases where the weights are adjusted so that the
 linear fit in the biased sample matches the mean of the SRS data.
 This sampling bias will be in addition to any other potential sources of
 bias, for example, non-normally distributed residuals or using a 
\begin_inset Formula $σ_{e}$
\end_inset

 that does not correspond to the same period.
 The bias is in addition to all the other potential sources of bias of the
 imputation.

For Gini, a similar issue is at play.
 Because biasing a sample by excluding households at the bottom of the distribut
ion will likely lead to lower 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{var}[xβ]$
\end_inset

, which is not addressed by the re-weighting procedure used, keeping everything
 else equal leads to a downward biased estimate of Gini (Figure

As encouraging as these results are, it is not possible to apply these to
 S2S imputation across time.
 The reason for this is because the true or a valid estimate of the mean
 for the dependent variable (which would be equal to the mean linear fit)
 or the variance of the linear fit would be unknown.

\begin_layout Standard
For accurate poverty measurement countries frequently resort to collect
 surveys on the living standards of its population.
 These surveys are costly and their implementation is complex.
 Thus, data is infrequently collected for the world's poorest economies.
 It is for these instances where S2S's appeal is heightened.
 The main applications of S2S over time attempt to:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Produce a poverty estimate that is comparable.
 There are many instances where a country may collect data on living standards,
 however due to any number of issues, the welfare aggregate is not comparable
 to a previous one.
 S2S has been applied in these scenarios by training a model on the original
 welfare aggregate and applying this to more recent survey (see the imputation
 of Zambia – 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "yoshida2024enabling"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Note that this could also be done backwards.
 If the preferred welfare aggregate corresponds to the new survey then the
 model could be trained on the new data and its parameters applied to the
 old data to predict poverty (see the imputation of Nigeria –

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Produce a poverty estimate when data on living standards is unavailable.
 In most instances where S2S is applied the country has recently collected
 data that does not include a comparable welfare aggregate, e.g., a recent
 Demographic Health Survey or a Labor Force Survey.
 In these instances, the model is trained on the last existing living standards
 survey with an adequate welfare aggregate and its estimated parameters
 are applied to the more recent survey – i.e.
 the target survey.
 The target survey is assumed to be nationally representative, but this
 is not always the case – for example, due to sampling bias (see the work
 of

 A key assumption when imputing to a different period than the one used
 to train the model is that the estimated parameters remain constant over
 time

 This implies that the relationship between covariates and the dependent
 variable is stable, and the distribution of unobservables does not change.
 Essentially, this assumes that any shifts in the welfare distribution are
 entirely driven by changes in the covariates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Early work on S2S 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "stifel2007tracking"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 often recommended selecting covariates that may vary over time but maintain
 a stable relationship with welfare—a challenging criterion to meet in practice.
 Furthermore, restricting the eligible covariates for the model can result
 in insufficient explanation of the variation in welfare.
 This, in turn, increases reliance on the distribution of unobservables,
 which is based on the training data and may not reflect the target period
 accurately.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section the discussion focuses on how changes in the parameters
 can affect the poverty predictions.
 Through simulated data components can be adjusted one at a time to identify
 how these may impact predictions.
 In practice, it is possible that any of the parameters used for the imputation
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\beta,\:\sigma\right)$
\end_inset

 has changed over time, however it is impossible to know if changes compound
 or cancel each other.
 This requires careful consideration when applying these methods.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Changes in the Residual's Distribution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is possible, though unlikely, for the relationship between covariates
 and the dependent variable to remain constant over time while poverty levels
 still change.
 The change can be driven entirely by changes in the unobservables.
 Changes in the unobservables also implies a change in inequality.
 To illustrate this, the same population created in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Creating-populations"
plural "false"

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 is used.
 The simulation consists in keeping the linear fit constant and only change
 the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{e}$
\end_inset

.
 Results are presented in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Change-in-poverty_sigma"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, and illustrate how poverty rates change under different lines determined
 at the percentile of the original welfare.
 Hence, if the original poverty rate was 25 percent, and using that same
 threshold when lowering the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{e}$
\end_inset

 by 25 percent, the resulting poverty rate would be of 22.3 percent.
 At higher thresholds the gap between the original poverty rate and the
 new rates is less noticeable, although still present.

Changes in the Constant Term
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When conducting imputations over time, changes to the constant term are
 seldom considered.
 Failing to capture a change in the constant term can lead to relatively
 stagnant predictions over time.
 It will also lead to predictions that are considerably off.
 In Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Change-in-poverty_intercept"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 the true constant term is adjusted by 
\begin_inset Formula $x\%$
\end_inset

 in the data generating process for the target data.
 Even slight changes lead to considerable differences in poverty.
 Imagine a scenario where transformed welfare for everyone has increased
 by 
\begin_inset Formula $1\%$
\end_inset

 (Under GDP growth, for example.), yet everything else about the welfare
 distribution remains the same.
 This would entail a neutral distribution shift to the right, and thus everyone'
s transformed welfare is improved by 1%.
 However, relying on a model fit on data before the increase would predict
 a constant term that is lower than what it really is after the increase
 in welfare.
 This would lead to imputations that considerably overestimate poverty for
 the new period.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Omitted variables and endogeneity have traditionally not been major concerns
 in S2S or small area estimation.
 This is because, in the current period, any omitted variables are accounted
 for by the constant term, which adjusts to ensure that OLS predictions
 of the dependent variable remain unbiased.
 However, over time, the effects of omitted variables can influence predictions
 considerably.
 For a more detailed discussion, see the annex (Annex

 The authors presume that the decrease in poverty predicted in rural areas
 is driven by a reduction in conflict.
 The models do not control for conflict.
 Additionally, the authors follow recommendations of the SWIFT program and
 include 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fast-changing consumption variables to better capture welfare changes during
 shocks
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, p6).
 Among the variables the authors include to the model are a list of food
 consumption dummies that include meat, eggs, and chocolate.
 However, it is quite likely that the model used by the authors suffers
 from omitted variable bias.
 Mainly, conflict is likely negatively correlated to expenditure and is
 also likely to be negatively correlated to these consumption dummies as
 it may affect the availability of these goods.
 The discussion in the annex (Annex 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:ann_ovb"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) illustrates that in this case, the omission of conflict from the model
 is likely to lead to biased estimates of poverty due to omitted variable
 bias (OVB).
 
\end_layout

To simulate the potential impact of omitted variable bias on poverty predictions
 over time the data simulated in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 is expanded to include 2 new covariates: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Conflict.

 equal to -0.3.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate

\begin_inset Formula $\left(0.5x+0.5Conflict\right)$
\end_inset

, with 
\begin_inset Formula $x=1$
\end_inset

 in the baseline.
 The DGP for the covariate illustrates the negative correlation of conflict
 and the likelihood of purchasing eggs.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Under the baseline simulation, the value for 
\begin_inset Formula $x=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c=0.4$
\end_inset

.
 Welfare is simulated assuming the true DGP, and thus includes conflict
 and eggs with their true coefficients.
 The prediction model is produced omitting conflict and is executed using
 the complete data to avoid other potential sources of bias (Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Omitted-variable-model"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 As presented in Annex 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:ann_ovb"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the coefficient on eggs is upward biased.
 Due to the omission of conflict, the constant term of the regression is
 downward biased.
 The adjustment in the constant term ensures that the model's prediction
 of the dependent variable is unbiased.
 As can be seen, omitting conflict from the model also leads to a larger
 RMSE, which will likely affect poverty predictions over time.
 Nevertheless, for predictions to the same period OVB has little if any
 impact (

For the simulation, different values of 
\begin_inset Formula $c$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 are determined, which yield a change in conflict likelihood and egg purchases.
 No other covariate is changed.
 Using the adjusted covariates, the true resulting welfare is calculated
 – including conflict and the correct coefficients.
 Then the model parameters obtained from the original data, excluding conflict,
 is used to obtain predictions of poverty across the welfare distribution.
 As can be seen in the discussion in the Annex

 In such a case, S2S predictions over time would likely show an increase

 The inclusion of

The impact of omitted variable bias extends beyond “fast-changing” consumption
 variables.
 Consider a model that includes an indicator for subsistence farmers, who
 are more likely to be poor and thus negatively correlated with welfare.
 Now imagine a massive drought occurs between the year the model was trained
 and the target year.
 This drought could reduce the number of people farming.
 If those former farmers are unable to meet their needs, the model might
 underestimate poverty because it omitted the effect of the drought.
 Another example involves the omission of remittances which are positively
 related to welfare and likely positively related to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fast-changing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 consumption variables, such as eggs or meat.
 Under this instance the coefficient on eggs would be upward biased, and
 since the impact of the omitted variable will be absorbed by the intercept
 it will likely also be upward biased.
 Thus, changes in remittances that are not captured by the model are likely
 to lead to biased predictions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The magnitude and direction of the bias that arises due to OVB is often
 not clear and could compound other biases just as easily as it could be
 offset by other biases.
 Nevertheless, unless actual welfare data are available for the imputed
 year it is impossible to truly know how the model is performing.

 However, since conflict is not explicitly included in their model, its
 effects would only manifest through changes in other variables.
 This potential omitted variable bias raises concerns about the model's
 reliability for temporal predictions.
 When imputing over time, it is possible for multiple issues to arise.
 Since true expenditure is not available it is impossible to know if the
 model's biases cancel eachother out or compound.
\end_layout

A key aspect of the team's imputation is the inclusion of fast changing

 This is what the authors refer to as the

 Nevertheless, these variables are likely subject to omitted variable bias
 which can lead to biased estimates of the coefficients leading to biased
 poverty measures.
 In the case of the Afghanistan imputation the omitted variable is conflict.
 In others it may be the introduction of a cash transfer, for example.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If conflict is negatively related to expenditure and negatively related
 to consumption of certain goods, such as meat and eggs, this would lead
 to coefficients that are upward biased.
 Assume the following, simplified, model:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Y=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}Eggs+\beta_{2}Conflict+\varepsilon\label{eq:full_egg_conflict}

\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $u=\beta_{2}Conflict+\varepsilon$

.
 In a model where conflict is not included 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\beta}_{1}$
\end_inset

would be greater than 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{1}$
\end_inset

 The OLS estimator for 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\beta}_{1}$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

and relying on the linearity of covariance:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\tilde{\beta}_{1}=\beta_{1}+\frac{\beta_{2}\mathrm{Cov}\left(Eggs,Conflict\right)}{\mathrm{Var}\left[Eggs\right]}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since we assume that conflict and welfare are negatively correlated, and
 negatively correlated with the likelihood of buying eggs, then we know
 that 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{2}<0$
\end_inset

 and that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{Cov}\left(Eggs,Conflict\right)<0$
\end_inset

.
 This would lead to 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\beta_{2}\mathrm{Cov}\left(Eggs,Conflict\right)}{\mathrm{Var}\left[Eggs\right]}>0$
\end_inset

 which means that 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\beta}_{1}$

In addition, the intercept will be underestimated.

we know that

When predicting over time, the direction of the prediction bias is dictated

and while they could cancel eachother out, it is unlikely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that since poverty also depends on the model's predicted root mean
 squared error (
\begin_inset Formula $RMSE$
\end_inset

), which would change over time since it is a function of the omitted variable
 – conflict – then there are 2 sources of bias.
 The first is due to the egg coefficient and the intercept, and the second
 is due to the difference in the distribution of errors which changes due
 to the omitted variable.
 A decrease in conflict would potentially lead to a shrinking of the 
\begin_inset Formula $RMSE$

, lowering the poverty likelihood of households but would be ignored in
 the Afghanistan exercise.

Many teams run into the issue of doing SAE to a dataset that is not necessarily
 the census.
 They have to either do it to a 10% sample of the census, or to some other
 larger survey that is representative at the level desired.
 In the past, before the updates to censusEB, this was treated like a survey
 to survey imputation.
 This would account for the within survey variation (from the sampling)
 and the between survey variation.
 I’m uncertain if this would still work since the noise estimation approach
 has considerably changed and we found evidence that the estimates in the
 past may have been underestimated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We tested by how much we would over or underestimate the noise when imputing

 What we found is that when imputing to a sample from the census, the noise
 estimate from the parametric bootstrap is actually overestimated.

 This is what I did: - I created 5000 populations: - I extract my survey

 Xs are fixed across populations - under each population I fit the model
 using the survey, and then obtain sae under each sample as the target survey.
 -MSE and bias is calculated by comparing to the poverty rates from the
 complete census The MSEs of the exercise above are below, the column represents

 The difference to the above is that in the exercise above, we estimate
