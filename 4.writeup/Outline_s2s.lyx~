\begin_layout Abstract
Accurate and timely poverty measurement is central to development policy,
 yet the availability of high-quality household survey data remains limited—part
icularly in countries where poverty is most concentrated.
 Survey-to-survey (S2S) imputation has emerged as a practical response to
 this challenge, allowing practitioners to estimate poverty using surveys
 that lack direct welfare measures by borrowing information from other comprehen
sive surveys.
 A technical guide to the method is provided, revisiting its statistical
 underpinnings and testing its limitations through extensive model-based
 simulations.
 Through model-based simulations, the analysis demonstrates how violations
 of parameter stability, omitted variable bias, and shifts in survey design
 can introduce substantial errors—particularly when imputing across time
 or under economic and structural change.
 Results show that standard corrections such as re-weighting or covariate
 standardization may fail to eliminate these biases, especially when imputing
 across time or under structural change.
 The performance of alternative model specifications is also evaluated under
 various methods, including performance under heteroskedastic errors, non-normal
ity.
 The findings offer practical guidance for practitioners on when S2S imputation
 is likely to succeed, when it should be reconsidered, and how to communicate
 its limitations transparently in the context of poverty monitoring and
 policy design.

\begin_layout Standard
The measurement and monitoring of poverty are central to assessing global
 development progress.
 For the World Bank, whose twin goals include ending extreme poverty, the
 ability to track poverty reduction is fundamental to measuring institutional
 effectiveness and guiding policy decisions.
 Yet, a persistent challenge hampers this crucial task: the limited availability
 of recent, high-quality household survey data that includes information
 that allows for comparable measures of expenditure or income across time.
 This challenge is particularly acute in countries where poverty is most
 concentrated

In large, poverty-affected countries, such as India and Nigeria, gaps in
 household survey data have hindered global poverty monitoring.
 Together, these two economies account for a substantial share of the world's
 poor, meaning that they heavily influence global poverty trends.
 In India, official consumption survey data was unavailable between 2011
 and 2022.

 In Nigeria comparable survey data for poverty monitoring was absent between
 2009 and 2018.
 These data gaps not only affect our understanding of poverty at the country
 level but compromise our ability to produce reliable global poverty estimates
 and assess progress toward poverty reduction goals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Traditional poverty measurement relies on household surveys that collect
 detailed consumption or income data.
 These surveys represent substantial investments in both financial and human
 resources.
 They require extensive preparation, careful implementation, and place considera
ble burden on responding households, who must either maintain detailed consumpti
on diaries or participate in comprehensive recall interviews.
 The method of data collection itself can introduce significant biases into
 poverty estimates.
 For instance, consumption diaries – while theoretically more accurate –
 can lead to respondent fatigue and underreporting over time.
 Recall modules, on the other hand, may suffer from memory bias, with longer
 recall periods typically resulting in lower reported consumption.
 Research has shown that simply changing the recall period or the number
 of consumption items can lead to substantially different poverty estimates
 within the same population (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "beegle2012methods"

\end_inset

).
 These methodological challenges add another layer of complexity to the
 already demanding task of poverty measurement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The challenges of traditional poverty measurement become particularly acute
 during crises when standard survey operations are disrupted or impossible
 to conduct.
 Armed conflicts, natural disasters, health emergencies, and other humanitarian
 crises often prevent face-to-face household interviews precisely when poverty
 monitoring becomes most crucial.
 The COVID-19 pandemic provided a stark illustration of this challenge,
 as household survey efforts were halted globally at a time when understanding
 welfare impacts was most critical.
 Similar data collection constraints arise in conflict zones, where security
 concerns prevent enumerator access to households, or during natural disasters
 that displace populations and disrupt statistical operations.
 During such crises, policymakers and international organizations must resort
 to alternative methods for estimating poverty.
 Survey-to-survey imputation, often combined with rapid phone surveys or
 other alternative data collection methods, has emerged as a key tool for
 maintaining poverty monitoring during these challenging periods.
 However, these approaches come with their own limitations and potential
 biases that must be carefully considered.

 Global projections of poverty rely on GDP projections during the pandemic.
 The GDP projection for each country is used to shift the welfare distribution
 of a given country by the GDP per capita growth rate observed between year
 corresponding to the household survey collection and the desired year in
 the future.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Survey-to-survey (S2S) imputation has emerged as a methodological response
 to these data limitations.
 The method is often used as a way to produce poverty numbers when traditional
 welfare data collection is unavailable due to costs, complexity, conflict,
 or other reasons.
 The approach builds upon techniques originally developed for small area
 estimation (SAE) in poverty mapping, pioneered by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 and further refined by

 S2S imputation enables poverty estimation using surveys that lack direct
 welfare measures by:

\end_layout

Generating poverty estimates based on the predicted welfare distribution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While S2S and small area estimation share methodological foundations, they
 serve distinct purposes.
 Small area estimation, as developed by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 and advanced by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "molina2010small"

\end_inset

, typically applies nationally estimated models to census data to generate
 precise poverty estimates for small geographic areas.
 In contrast, S2S focuses on predicting welfare in a separate survey, regardless
 of geographic disaggregation.
 One might view traditional poverty mapping as a special case of S2S where
 the target dataset are the different areas of the census and the primary
 goal is obtaining geographically disaggregated estimates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paper first examines the limitations and potential pitfalls of survey-to-su
rvey imputation through rigorous analysis of its fundamental assumptions.
 This is a technical paper that relies on simulated data to conduct experiments.
 In these experiments, the focus is not on traditional concerns such as
 variable selection or model specification, but rather on the method's core
 limitations, particularly for measuring poverty across extended time periods
 or different populations.
 The analysis relies on simulated data to isolate and demonstrate specific
 mechanisms that can generate biased estimates.
 This approach allows for clear illustration of three critical findings:
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Standard sampling bias-correction techniques, such as re-weighting to match
 population means, may be insufficient when source and target surveys differ
 fundamentally.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The method's tendency to replicate the welfare distribution of the source
 survey can make it unreliable for measuring changes in inequality and poverty.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The model captures the joint distribution between 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 in the source data.
 The parameters corresponding to the source data are then applied to the
 target data, where the only difference is the distribution of covariates,
 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, unless all the change is captured by changes in the covariates the
 method will likely give biased estimates.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Thus, better communication behind the limitations of the methods are crucial.
 These insights are particularly relevant given the increasing reliance
 on survey-to-survey imputation to fill data gaps in poverty monitoring.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Third, omitted variable bias will likely affect poverty predictions, particularl
y when imputing across time periods that include significant economic shocks
 or structural changes.
 This last finding has important implications for applications that use
 "fast-moving" variables to capture welfare changes,

 refer to expenditure related covariates as fast moving.
 These include dichotomous variables indicating if a household reported
 purchasing a product or not.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 as these variables may introduce bias if they are correlated with unobserved
 factors that affect welfare.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Through systematic examination of these limitations using simplified examples,
 the paper provides practitioners with a framework for understanding when
 and why S2S methods may produce misleading results.
 The results here are of relevance since survey-to-survey imputation has
 become more prevalent in recent times to overcome data scarcity.

\begin_layout Standard
Collecting household consumption data is costly and complex.
 Consumption modules typically span multiple domains—food, housing, health,
 education, and more—each requiring detailed recall and careful categorization.
 As 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "deaton1998consumption"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 observe, these modules are among the most demanding components of household
 surveys, often encompassing hundreds of items and multiple recall periods.
 This not only increases respondent burden but also drives up implementation
 costs.
 Ensuring accuracy adds another layer of complexity: respondents may forget
 or misreport expenditures, and cultural and regional differences often
 require localized adaptations in survey design.
 Moreover, as 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "beegle2012methods"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 demonstrate, even small changes in how surveys are administered can yield
 significant differences in reported poverty and consumption levels.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because of these challenges, few countries collect comparable welfare data
 frequently.
 Long-term, harmonized consumption trends are the exception, not the norm.
 Yet, policymakers, donors, and development practitioners continually need
 up-to-date poverty statistics.
 To fill this gap, survey-to-survey imputation has become an increasingly
 used method for estimating poverty when consumption or income data are
 unavailable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
S2S builds upon the idea proposed by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "elbers2003micro,jesko1998"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 where a linear regression model is fit on a survey where expenditure or
 income are available to determine the joint distribution of expenditure
 or income, and a given set of household characteristics – this survey is
 typically referred to as the source or training data.
 The model parameters are then applied to a separate dataset (the target
 data) where the same set of household characteristics can be found with
 the aim of replicating the welfare distribution via imputation.
 With a simulated welfare in hand, poverty estimates and other welfare indicator
s can be derived from the target data.
 The methods can be applied to contemporaneous surveys or to surveys correspondi
ng to a different point in time.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The method is useful when applied to contemporaneous surveys to obtain statistic
s across the welfare distribution for indicators that are not available
 in the living standards survey.
 For example, the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) provide a litany
 of health related indicators that are not available in most living standards
 surveys.
 This is where S2S comes into play.
 A model trained on the living standards survey and applied to the DHS can
 help us inform about the difference in stunting rates between poor and
 non-poor households or determine how it varies across the welfare distribution.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The method is often treated as a prediction exercise and unlike much of
 econometrics, the parameters of the linear regression are not intended
 to capture only the direct effect of the characteristics on welfare (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "elbers2003micro"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, p356).
 Nevertheless, the original intent of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "elbers2003micro"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 was to predict on to the same population.
 As will be later shown, when attempting to predict to a different point
 in time, particularly when considerable underlying changes in the economy
 and society have taken place (droughts, earthquakes, floods, conflict,
 etc.), this assumption can lead to potentially biased estimates.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When imputing to a different year, the method rests on the assumption that
 model parameters remain stable—that is, the relationship between household
 characteristics and welfare has not changed.
 This assumption becomes tenuous in settings experiencing structural change,
 economic growth, or major shocks.
 In other words, the method assumes that model parameters remain stationary
 over time – meaning that any observed changes in poverty are solely attributabl
e to changes in the model's covariates, rather than shifts in unobservable
 factors or changing returns to these covariates (Dang, Lanjouw and Serajuddin
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citebyear
key "dang2017"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 This assumption becomes particularly tenuous in dynamic economic contexts.
 As 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "christiaensen2012small"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 note, such assumptions may be especially problematic in rapidly growing
 economies, where structural economic changes can alter the relationship
 between poverty and its predictors.
 It can also be problematic when a strong shock has occurred between the
 periods – for example, a global pandemic or changes in a country's fragility.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Researchers and practitioners have proposed various approaches to address
 the limitations of S2S in predicting poverty over time.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "stifel2007tracking"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 advocate for including time-varying variables such as rainfall and prices
 to capture temporal changes.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "SwiftMethod"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 suggest incorporating variables that track economic conditions more directly,
 like indicators on whether the household consumed a given good.
 However, as 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "SwiftMethod"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 emphasize, without updated training data to re-estimate model parameters,
 the risk of missing significant economic changes remains substantial, even
 with these additional covariates.
 A similar point is raised by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "mathiassen2009model"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 who emphasizes that the validity of imputations rests on a strong assumption
 of parameter stability and explicitly warns against extrapolating too far
 across time or applying the method when significant changes in welfare
 dynamics or survey design are likely.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "dang2025poverty"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 further note that evidence on the utility of granular consumption predictors
 remains inconclusive, and instead advocate for parsimonious models that
 are easier to implement in surveys and in challenging field conditions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The effectiveness of S2S imputation across time has been tested in a range
 of contexts, with results showing both its potential and its limitations.
 While some studies report estimates within acceptable margins of error
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "dang2025poverty"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "https://doi.org/10.1111/roiw.12007"

), others find significant discrepancies between predicted and observed
 poverty rates (

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "https://doi.org/10.1111/roiw.12007"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 These mixed findings highlight the need for caution when applying S2S imputatio
n across different periods and economic environments.
 A useful example comes from Malawi, where 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "mathiassen2021predicting"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 document their efforts to produce comparable poverty estimates between
 2004 and 2014.
 While their method performed well within individual surveys and with careful
 seasonal adjustment, comparability across survey rounds proved fragile.
 Shifts in survey design and implementation such as shorter questionnaires,
 periods of data collection, changing field protocols, and others led to
 unstable predictor relationships and inconsistent poverty trends over time.
 Even in this relatively well-structured case, the authors conclude that
 S2S imputation should only be used when comparability of predictors and
 survey instruments can be assured (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "mathiassen2021predicting"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most evidence on bias in cross-time S2S estimates comes from real-world
 applications where time gaps are large or covariate distributions differ
 substantially.
 For example, Dang, Lanjouw and Serajuddin (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 The authors perform survey-to-survey imputation in scenarios where there

\end_inset

 estimate of poverty.
 The authors validate their approach with data for Vietnam and for China
 using rural household panel data.
 In Vietnam, the authors obtain a model using the 1992/93 data and predict
 poverty using the 1997/98 data.
 They note that the method works relatively well and depending on the covariates
 used, differences between predicted and observed poverty rates were on
 average 3.4 percentage points during a period where poverty fell by 23.2
 percentage points.
 For the Chinese regions where the method was tested, the authors also find
 that the methods work relatively well.
 However, depending on the model used, differences between predicted and
 observed rates were considerable.
 This highlights the method's conundrum: different models may generate different
 findings, and at least some models may get it right.
 However, ex-ante, it is very difficult to determine which model will yield
 the most accurate estimates or even the right estimates.
 So far, no foolproof methods or diagnostics exist to reliably identify
 the ideal model, raising fundamental concerns about the robustness of imputed
 poverty estimates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Applications of survey to survey imputation have also made their way to
 global poverty monitoring.
 For example, until recently every poverty number for India after 2011 is
 based on an imputation.

 The method was originally proposed to fill in missing observations and
 considered the nature of the missing data (

 The goal of multiple imputation is not to create a single prediction, but
 rather multiple imputations to reflect the uncertainty around the actual
 value (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 By generating plausible values for missing data, multiple imputation allows
 for valid estimation and the construction of appropriate confidence intervals

 For example, in the case of a regression on agricultural yields the variable
 capturing plot sizes may have missing values and these must be imputed
 with the aim of not losing information as well as obtaining a valid estimate
 of the coefficient for the relationship between land and yields.
 Using multiple imputation in this example, as opposed to just the predicted
 land size, is expected to reduce the rate of false positives.

Survey-to-survey (S2S) imputation for poverty measurement relies on the
 assumption that a population's welfare distribution can be captured by
 a linear model which is estimated on the

 For simplicity, the subscript 
\begin_inset Formula $target$

 Hence, the assumed data generating process (DGP) for transformed welfare

 Their analysis shows that appropriate transformation of the dependent variable

An additional method that can be paired with machine learning techniques

 PMM is notably less sensitive to model misspecification and is robust to

 typically yield similar results to those based on

 The number of donors (i.e.
 neighbors) is determined by the practitioner.

 These preconditions ensure that the fundamental assumption – both surveys

 Having 2 contemporaneous surveys which represent the same population are

Survey-to-survey (S2S) imputation provides a valuable tool for filling gaps

.
 The core assumption—that changes in welfare reflect only shifts in observable
 characteristics, with stable relationships between covariates and welfare—becom
es increasingly fragile as the time between surveys grows.
 Structural economic change, evolving labor markets, and shifting household
 behaviors can all violate this assumption, leading to imputation errors
 that distort actual welfare dynamics.
 Moreover, S2S methods tend to reproduce the welfare distribution of the
 source survey: coefficients capture the joint distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 from the source period, and errors are drawn from that same model in the
 source data.
 As a result, households with identical characteristics in the source and
 target periods are assigned identical poverty probabilities, regardless
 of contextual changes.
 The same limitations that affect contemporaneous S2S imputation—chiefly,
 its tendency to replicate the structure of the source data—are likely to
 be amplified when imputing across time, further constraining the method’s
 ability to track true changes in poverty and inequality.
 Given the growing reliance on S2S for poverty monitoring, even subtle distortio
ns can mislead policy.
 Practitioners should therefore apply these methods with caution, rigorously
 test validity across time periods, and clearly communicate the method's
 limitations.

The Variance Decomposition Challenge

\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{var}\left[x\hat{\beta}\right]=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}\left(x_{i}\hat{\beta}-\bar{x}\hat{\beta}\right)^{2}$
\end_inset

, and
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The unexplained random component: (
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{e}^{2}$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In well-specified models, the 
\begin_inset Formula $R^{2}$
\end_inset

 typically ranges from 0.40 to 0.60, meaning that a substantial portion of
 welfare variation remains unexplained.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $R^{2}$
\end_inset

 statistic represents the proportion of variance explained by the model:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
R^{2}=\frac{\mathrm{var}\left[x\hat{\beta}\right]}{\left(\mathrm{var}\left[x\hat{\beta}\right]+\hat{\sigma}_{e}^{2}\right)}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When imputing across time, practitioners must rely on an error distribution
 (
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{e}^{2}$
\end_inset

) estimated from historical data, same as 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

.
 This implicitly assumes that households with the same characteristics face
 the same probability of being poor across different time periods.
 However, a critical limitation arises from the assumption of constant parameter
s over time.
 In reality, parameters often change, especially in rapidly developing countries
 or over long time horizons, as highlighted in micro decomposition techniques
 such as those of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "bourguignon2008beyond"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This implies that the estimated contributions of changes in characteristics
 may not fully reflect actual poverty or inequality levels but rather the
 role of compositional shifts in shaping welfare evolution.
 In other words, instead of measuring the true welfare distribution, the
 method may only capture the effect of compositional shifts – how the population
’s characteristics are changing over time.
 The assumption of stable parameters when characteristics change significantly
 becomes increasingly restrictive, leading to potential bias in predicted
 welfare levels.

 A model trained on data from one year may produce biased estimates when
 used to predict welfare in another year, as both omitted variables and

 poverty in years where a welfare aggregate is unavailable (see Annex

Implications for Inequality Measurement
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The challenges noted in previous sections extend to inequality measurement.
 The reliance on error distributions obtained from a different point in
 time, particularly affects inequality measurement.
 Under the common assumption of log-normally distributed welfare, the Gini
 coefficient depends critically on the welfare distribution's standard deviation.
 Using an outdated error distribution can thus produce misleading inequality
 estimates, even when mean predictions appear reasonable.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assuming that welfare is log-normally distributed then Gini is equal to

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $σ$

 is the empirical standard deviation of

 Consequently, the imputed Gini across time is also dependent on 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{σ}{}_{e}^{2}$
\end_inset

, which is estimated in an older survey and the resulting empirical variance
 of the linear fit,
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{var}\left[x\hat{\beta}\right]$

and consequently, is also subject to changes in the sample’s distribution
 of the observed characteristics used in the model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The method's tendency to replicate the welfare distribution of the source
 survey can make it unreliable for measuring changes in inequality and poverty.
 This suggests that survey-to-survey imputation across time periods should
 be approached with considerable caution, particularly when economic conditions
 or social structures have changed significantly between the source and
 target periods.
 Given the increasing reliance on these methods to fill data gaps in poverty
 monitoring, it is crucial to clearly communicate their limitations to avoid
 misinterpretation of trends.
 Moreover, imputed poverty estimates should be systematically validated
 against other proxies for household welfare, such as national accounts,
 labor market indicators, and administrative data, to ensure consistency
 and identify potential discrepancies.

Why simulate the errors?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Survey-to-survey (S2S) imputation of poverty is not simply about predicting
 the dependent variable.
 Relying solely on the predicted value of welfare to derive poverty rates
 often yields poor results.
 This section uses the synthetic population introduced in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We fit a linear model on a simple random sample (SRS) comprising 20 percent
 of the population.
 This model is then used to generate two sets of predicted values for the
 full data:

\begin_layout Standard
Figure

 hows that relying solely on the linear prediction, 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}\hat{\beta},$
\end_inset

 fails to replicate the true distribution of welfare.
 For example, if the true poverty line is 2.39—corresponding to a 20 percent
 poverty rate in the actual data—then the linear prediction alone would
 imply a poverty rate of only 10 percent.
 This gap persists despite the fact that the linear prediction has a lower
 mean squared error (MSE = 0.25) than the version with stochastic error (MSE
 = 0.5).
 This demonstrates that minimizing MSE is not sufficient for reproducing
 the distributional properties needed to estimate poverty accurately.
 Moreover, the Spearman rank correlation is higher for the linear prediction
 than for the version with added error.
 In other words, correctly ranking households is also not enough to replicate
 the full welfare distribution or derive accurate poverty statistics.

 This distinction is relevant for Proxy Means Testing (PMT), where the goal

 As

\begin_layout Standard
In this context, when evaluated in-sample, random forests outperform OLS
 in classification tasks—even though OLS is more closely aligned with the

).
 When applied to the same data used for modeling, random forest classifies
 households with notably higher accuracy.
 However, this advantage disappears when applied to the entire population
 (i.e., from where the SRS sample was taken from) where the classification
 performance of random forests closely matches that of OLS (Tables

PMM - A flexible imputation approach 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A common alternative imputation approach, predictive mean matching (PMM),
 differs in its simulation strategy.
 Rather than drawing residuals or estimating parameters from a posterior
 distribution, PMM matches observations from the source dataset to those
 in the target dataset based on predicted values, ensuring that imputed
 values remain within the observed range of the source data.
\begin_inset Foot

\end_inset

 This method is particularly useful when handling non-normal or discontinuous
 distributions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

.
 However, its reliance on observed values limits its ability to capture
 shifts in economic conditions between periods, similar to other approaches
 presented in the section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To illustrate PMM’s limitations, a simulation is conducted where a covariate
 distribution in the target dataset is altered, creating a mismatch with
 the source data.
 Under the simulation, the 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{2}$
\end_inset

 variable is adjusted to take a value of 1 when a random uniform number
 between 0 and 1 is less than 0.8 instead of the original 0.2.
 This is only done for the target data.
 The model is fit on the original data, but the imputations are made on
 the adjusted data.
 Despite this shift, PMM follows OLS-based predictions closely (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:bias_pmm"
plural "false"
caps "false"

\end_inset

).
 However, in a second simulation where economic growth of 20 percent is
 introduced between the source and target periods,
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The only change introduced is a change in the constant term, everything
 else remains equal between source and target data.

These findings underscore that no single imputation method is universally
 optimal.
 The choice of approach should be guided by the data’s properties, the error
 distribution, and the degree of economic and social change between surveys.
 Parametric methods can introduce bias when their assumptions are violated,
 while empirical residual drawing and heteroskedasticity-aware models tend
 to offer more robust alternatives.
 Machine learning techniques, particularly when combined with bootstrapping,
 also show promise for future applications.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The simulation results demonstrate that while many imputation methods perform
 well under ideal conditions, their effectiveness varies considerably when
 faced with different error structures and data characteristics.
 Direct application of parameters ("Fixed B") yields low bias under normal
 error distributions, but when assumptions are violated—as with Student’s
 t-distributed or heteroskedastic errors—methods using empirical residual
 drawing perform better.
 Machine learning approaches, such as lasso regression combined with empirical
 residuals, show potential but require careful implementation.
 Conversely, the limitations of Predictive Mean Matching (PMM) become more
 pronounced when economic conditions change between the training and target
 periods—though, such instability can affect all models.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall, these results highlight the importance of selecting imputation
 methods that are well-suited to the specific data context, error distribution,
 and stability of conditions across surveys.
 Future work could usefully extend bootstrap-based techniques to a wider
 range of machine learning methods, while ensuring robust error estimation
 remains central.

Noise estimation

\begin_layout Standard
A word of caution is warranted here and it is related to how noise is estimated.
 When applying MI methods the noise is typically estimated using Rubin's
 rules 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "rubin1987multiple"
literal "false"

.
 Under Rubin's rules the estimated variance is equal to the sum of within-imputa
tion variance, the between imputation variance, and the between imputation
 variance divided by the number of imputations.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Under Rubin's rules: 
\begin_inset Formula $T=W+(1+\frac{1}{M})B$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is the total variance, 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 is the number of imputations, 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 is the within survey variance, and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 is the between imputation variance.
 Based on Rubin's rules, the imputed indicator cannot have a variance that
 is smaller than it would have if it were collected directly in the target
 survey.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 It is important to remember that these methods were developed for regression
 analysis, where a variable with missing observations is imputed and then
 used in a model.
 Rubin's rules are applied in those instances to obtain a valid standard
 error of the regression parameters.
 Estimating the prediction's noise in a similar manner when parameters are
 applied directly risks producing improper imputations.

 Both methods here appear to overestimate the true MSE.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The method's MSE/variance is the average from the 10,000 imputations.
 The empirical MSE is: 
\begin_inset Formula $MSE=\sum_{b=1}\frac{\left(\hat{\tau}_{b}-\tau_{b}\right)^{2}}{B}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 is the indicator of interest and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 is the total number of bootstrap populations.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The reason for the overestimation is that both methods measure the noise
 based on the target survey which is smaller than the population.
 The MSE is equal to the sum of the squared bias and the variance of the
 indicator of interest.
 Since both methods are nearly unbiased, it mostly boils down to the variance
 and given that the target survey is much smaller than the population the
 variance parameter of the MSE is larger (see Annex

).
 However, further caution is warranted in instances where the estimates
 are likely biased since the variance estimated following Rubin's rules
 will yield a downward biased estimate of the true noise.

Imputations under biased samples

\begin_layout Standard
Survey-to-survey (S2S) imputation methods are often applied to biased samples,
 such as when specific population segments are systematically underrepresented.
 To address this issue, practitioners commonly attempt two corrective strategies
: re-weighting the sample or standardizing covariates.
 This section examines these methods and evaluates their effectiveness using
 simulations.

Re-weighting the target sample
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Re-weighting involves adjusting the sampling weights in the target survey
 to align its characteristics with those of the overall population.
 One common approach, minimum cross-entropy,
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
When the original sampling weights of the target survey are ignored, it
 is assumed that every observation had a similar probability of being selected,
 then the re-weighting method is max-entropy (see Golan, Judge and Miller
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeyearpar

\end_inset

 for a more thorough exposition of maximum entropy).
\end_layout

\end_inset

 modifies the weights to match constraints like the mean or variance of
 key covariates.
 While theoretically sound, re-weighting assumes that adjusted weights can
 restore the representativeness of a biased sample.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To test the problems with biased samples and re-weighting, two sampling
 scenarios are used as an illustrative example.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Standardizing covariates
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Standardizing covariates offers a straightforward approach to addressing
 disparities between survey samples.
 Using data from the source survey (or training data), where the model is
 initially estimated, practitioners can leverage the known means and variances
 of each covariate to adjust the corresponding variables in the target survey.
 This alignment ensures that the mean and variance of covariates in the
 imputed data match those of the source data, enhancing comparability.

 advocate this approach as a practical solution for reconciling differences
 between survey samples.
 Their application of the method to Jordanian data suggests that it can
 yield valid results under certain conditions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The method's efficacy depends on the assumption that covariates follow a
 normal distribution – an assumption that may not hold universally.
 To assess the robustness of this approach, the samples described in Section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Extracting-samples"
plural "false"

\end_inset

 were used, despite the fact that the covariates in this case deviate from
 normality.
 The adjustment process involves scaling and centering the covariates from
 the target survey so that their means and variances align with those of
 the source survey, as shown in the following formula:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x_{target}^{'}=(x_{target}-\hat{\mu}_{x_{target}})\frac{\hat{\sigma}_{x}}{\hat{\sigma}_{x_{target}}}+\hat{\mu}_{x}

To isolate the impact of biased sampling in the target data and assess the
 effectiveness of correction methods, the analysis avoids introducing additional
 sources of error by using the true values for the coefficients (

) applied in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 Poverty and Gini coefficients were then calculated for each of these 100
 vectors using either re-weighted survey weights or standardized covariates.
 The final estimates were obtained by averaging across the 100 simulations,
 and bias was determined by comparing these estimates to the true population
 values across the 1,000 populations, resulting in a robust evaluation of
 the methods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Standard sampling bias-correction techniques, such as re-weighting to match
 population means, may be insufficient when source and target surveys differ
 fundamentally—i.e., when they do not appear to capture the same underlying
 population, with differing moments of the covariate distributions and altered
 relationships (covariances) between covariates and outcomes.
 In such cases, large differences in the covariate distributions suggest
 that the two surveys do not represent the same underlying population.
 This limitation becomes evident in bottom-biased samples, where the poorest
 segments of the population were underrepresented, leading to systematic
 underestimation of poverty levels across the welfare distribution (Figure

 Efforts to address this bias by adjusting survey weights to match covariate
 means had no noticeable effect (“Match X”).

Since the weights assume no priors, these are in fact calculated using maximum
 entropy.
 When prior weights are considered the method adjusts the existing weights
 by the smallest possible amount to ensure the constraints match, this is
 known as cross-entropy.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Incorporating additional constraints to the maximum entropy algorithm,
 such as aligning both means and variances of covariates, provided marginal
 improvements but failed to address the core issue of sampling distortion
 (“Match X and var[X]”).

A more effective approach involved aligning the mean of the linear fit of

) in the target data with the average linear fit of the source data (
\begin_inset Quotes eld

).
 This adjustment yielded significantly improved estimates, as did standardizing
 individual covariates (
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 However, the best performing estimates incorporate the mean of the linear

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 in determining poverty estimates, as outlined in Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 However, it is important to note that the adjustments made here mimic the
 moments of the source data, thus when applied to other data would just
 replicate the source data's welfare distribution.
 Consequently the approaches would be of use for contemporaneous S2S, but
 not for S2S over time.
 
\end_layout

For top-and-bottom-biased samples, where both the poorest and wealthiest

 mirrored the earlier findings (Figure

 Unadjusted estimates again misrepresented poverty and inequality, while
 methods that accounted for the mean and variance of the linear fit provided
 more accurate results.
 Importantly, results varied significantly across the welfare distribution.
 Biases that appeared negligible at certain thresholds, such as the 40th
 percentile, became pronounced elsewhere, highlighting the importance of
 evaluating imputations across the full distribution.

Implications for Gini Estimation

The challenges extend to inequality measurement.
 Biasing a sample by excluding low-income households reduces 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{var}\left[x\beta\right]$
\end_inset

, which standard re-weighting methods fail to address (i.e.
 only addressing differences in the mean).
 This limitation results in downward-biased Gini estimates (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 The issue is even more pronounced for top-and-bottom-biased samples, where

\begin_layout Standard
Despite encouraging results for correcting bias in cross-sectional samples,
 these methods cannot be directly applied to S2S imputation across time.
 The main limitation is the lack of reliable estimates for the mean and
 variance of the dependent variable in the target period.
 Without these benchmarks, standardization or reweighting becomes ineffective,
 compounding the challenges of imputing poverty estimates in dynamic contexts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moreover, when applying S2S to real-world data, the model used is just one
 of many possible choices.
 The implicit assumption is that this model represents the true data-generating
 process (DGP).
 In practice, there are few clear criteria to select one model over another
 for poverty imputation.
 Even a model that fits the source data well offers little guarantee of
 robust performance when applied across time.
 Assuming that the estimated model remains valid over time is a particularly
 strong assumption.
 As noted by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

, a high model 
\begin_inset Formula $R^{2}$
\end_inset

 does not necessarily translate into accurate poverty predictions.
 As this section will show, multiple potential sources of bias can arise
 when applying S2S over time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because household living standards surveys are costly and infrequently collected
—especially in low-income countries—S2S has become an appealing option in
 many contexts.
 Its main applications over time include::
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Producing comparable poverty estimates: In many countries, surveys may exist,
 but the welfare aggregate is not comparable across rounds.
 S2S has been used to bridge this gap by training a model on the original
 welfare aggregate and applying it to a more recent survey (e.g., Zambia as
 noted by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "yoshida2024enabling"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 This process can also be reversed—if the preferred welfare aggregate is
 from the newer survey, the model can be trained on that data and applied
 retrospectively (e.g., Nigeria, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "lain2022estimating"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Generating poverty estimates when no living standards data are available:
 In many cases, a recent survey (e.g., a DHS or labor force survey) does not
 include an adequate welfare aggregate.
 Here, a model trained on the last available living standards survey is
 used to impute poverty in the new survey (For example, see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "edochie2022we,lanjouw2024imputation,newhouse2019estimating"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 The target survey is often assumed to be nationally representative, though
 this is not always true—sampling bias can distort results (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

.
 A key assumption when imputing to a different period than the one used
 to train the model is that the estimated parameters remain constant over
 time 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "newhouse2014survey"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This implies that the relationship between covariates and the dependent
 variable is stable, and the distribution of unobservables does not change.
 Essentially, this assumes that any shifts in the welfare distribution are
 entirely driven by changes in the covariates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Early work on S2S 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "stifel2007tracking"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 often recommended selecting covariates that may vary over time but maintain
 a stable relationship with welfare – a challenging criterion to meet in
 practice.
 Furthermore, restricting the eligible covariates for the model can result
 in insufficient explanation of the variation in welfare.
 This, in turn, increases reliance on the distribution of unobservables,
 which is based on the source data used for the model and may not reflect
 the target period accurately.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section the discussion focuses on how changes in the parameters
 can affect the poverty predictions.
 Through simulated data components can be adjusted one at a time to identify
 how these may impact predictions.
 In practice, it is possible that any of the parameters used for the imputation
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\beta,\:\sigma\right)$
\end_inset

 has changed over time, however it is impossible to know if changes compound
 or cancel each other.
 This requires careful consideration when applying these methods and transparent
 communication so potential users, including policy makers, fully comprehend
 the limitations of the predictions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Changes in the Error's Distribution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is possible, though unlikely, for the relationship between covariates
 and the dependent variable to remain constant over time while poverty levels
 still change.
 The change can be driven entirely by changes in the distribution of the
 unobservables, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{e}^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Changes in the unobservables also implies a change in inequality.
 To illustrate this, the same population created in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Creating-populations"
plural "false"

 is used.
 The simulation consists in keeping the linear fit constant and only change
 the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{e}$
\end_inset

.
 This is done across the 1,000 populations where predictions are obtained
 from Eq.

, and illustrate how poverty rates change under different lines determined
 at the percentile of the original welfare.
 Hence, if the original poverty rate was 20 percent, and using that same
 corresponding poverty line when increasing the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{e}$
\end_inset

 by 20 percent, the resulting poverty rate would be biased upwards by over
 2 percentage points.
 At higher thresholds the gap between the original poverty rate and the
 new rates is less noticeable, although still present.
 Notably, estimates at the 50th percentile show no bias, reinforcing the
 importance of evaluating poverty predictions across the full welfare distributi
on.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Changes in the Constant Term
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When conducting imputations over time, changes to the constant term are
 seldom considered.
 Failing to capture a change in the constant term can lead to relatively
 stagnant predictions over time.
 It will also lead to predictions that are considerably off the mark.
 In Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Change-in-poverty_intercept"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 the true constant term is adjusted by 
\begin_inset Formula $x\%$
\end_inset

 in the data generating process for the target data.
 Even slight changes lead to considerable differences in poverty.
 Imagine a scenario where transformed welfare for everyone has increased
 by 
\begin_inset Formula $1\%$
\end_inset

 (Under GDP growth, for example.), yet everything else about the welfare
 distribution remains the same.
 This would entail a neutral distribution shift to the right, and thus everyone'
s transformed welfare is improved by 1%.
 However, relying on a model fit on data before the increase – even if everythin
g else remains the same – would use a constant term that is lower than what
 it really is after the increase in welfare.
 This would lead to imputations that considerably overestimate poverty for
 the new period.

Omitted Variables 
\begin_inset CommandInset label

name "subsec:Omitted-Variables"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Omitted variables and endogeneity have traditionally not been major concerns
 in predictions such as S2S or small area estimation.
 This is because, in the current period, any omitted variables are accounted
 for by the constant term and coefficients of covariates correlated to the
 omitted variable, which are adjusted to ensure that OLS predictions of
 the dependent variable remain unbiased.
 However, over time, the effects of omitted variables can influence predictions
 considerably.
 For a more detailed discussion, see the annex (Annex 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:ann_ovb"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider a plausible application of survey-to-survey (S2S) imputation in
 a conflict-affected rural setting.
 Suppose the model predicts a decline in poverty between two survey years.
 One potential interpretation might be that poverty fell as a result of
 reduced conflict.
 However, if the model does not explicitly control for conflict, this interpreta
tion may be misleading.
 In line with guidance from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "yoshida2022concept"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, the model might include fast-changing consumption indicators—such as whether
 households consumed meat, eggs, or chocolate—as proxies for welfare changes.
 Yet, if conflict both reduces consumption of these goods and suppresses
 household expenditure, then omitting conflict from the model could introduce
 omitted variable bias (OVB).
 This kind of misspecification can distort poverty estimates, particularly
 when key explanatory variables are correlated with both the outcome and
 unobserved shocks like insecurity (refer to Annex 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:ann_ovb"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To simulate the potential impact of omitted variable bias on poverty predictions
 over time the data simulated in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Creating-populations"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 is expanded to include 2 new covariates: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Conflict.
 Conflict is assumed to be negatively correlated with welfare with a coefficient
 equal to -0.3.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
It is simulated as a binary variable taking value 1 when a random uniform
 number between 0 and 1 is less than 
\begin_inset Formula $c=0.4$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Eggs purchased.
 The variable is assumed to be positively correlated to welfare with a coefficie
nt equal to 0.4.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
The variable is simulated as binary, taking the value 1 if a randomly drawn
 uniform number between 0 and 1 is less than 
\begin_inset Formula $0.5x-0.5\times Conflict$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $x=1$
\end_inset

 in the baseline.
 This data generation process (DGP) reflects the negative correlation between
 conflict and the likelihood of purchasing eggs but also that it is not
 just a function of conflict but of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 as well.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Under the baseline simulation, the value for 
\begin_inset Formula $x=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c=0.4$
\end_inset

.
 Welfare is simulated assuming the true DGP, and thus includes conflict
 and eggs with their true coefficients.
 The prediction model is produced omitting conflict and is executed using
 the complete data to avoid other potential sources of bias (Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Omitted-variable-model"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 As presented in Annex 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:ann_ovb"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the coefficient on eggs is upward biased.
 Due to the omission of conflict, the constant term of the regression is
 downward biased.
 The adjustment in the constant term ensures that the model's prediction
 of the dependent variable is unbiased.
 As can be seen, omitting conflict from the model also leads to a larger
 RMSE than the truth, which will likely affect poverty predictions over
 time.
 Nevertheless, for predictions to the same period OVB has little if any
 impact (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:ovb same period"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The reason for this is that even in the presence of OVB 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{var}\left[x\hat{\beta}\right]+\hat{\sigma}_{e}^{2}$
\end_inset

 will be the same to the one where conflict is present and since 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{y}$
\end_inset

 is also equal poverty predictions in the same period are unaffected.

 Using the adjusted covariates, the true resulting welfare is calculated
 – including conflict and the correct coefficients.
 Then the model parameters obtained from the original data, excluding conflict,
 is used to obtain predictions of poverty across the welfare distribution.

, the direction of the prediction bias is not immediately clear.
 In many instances the predictions will suggest an increase in poverty whereas
 in reality poverty has dropped.
 In other instances it may underestimate the total change.

Under the assumed data-generating process (DGP), imagine that conflict decreases
 by 50% (
\begin_inset Formula $c=0.2$

0.7) due to factors unrelated to conflict, for example changes in preferences.

Note that because of the relationship to conflict egg purchases do not actually
 drop by 30% since it is offset by the decrease in conflict.

\end_inset

 In such a case, S2S predictions over time would likely show an increase
 in poverty based on most thresholds.
 However, in reality, poverty would have actually decreased (Figure

 This is just an illustrative example where the purpose is to illustrate

 in instances that a major shock has occurred in between the year of the
 actual welfare data and the target data.
 The inclusion of

The impact of omitted variable bias extends beyond “fast-changing” consumption
 variables.
 Consider a model that includes an indicator for subsistence farmers, who
 are more likely to be poor and thus negatively correlated with welfare.
 Now imagine a massive drought occurs between the year the model was trained
 and the target year.
 This drought could reduce the number of people farming.
 If those former farmers are unable to meet their needs, the model might
 underestimate poverty because it omitted the effect of the drought.
 Another example involves the omission of remittances which are positively
 related to welfare and likely positively related to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fast-changing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 consumption variables, such as eggs or meat.
 Under this instance the coefficient on eggs would be upward biased, and
 since the impact of the omitted variable will be absorbed by the intercept
 it will likely also be upward biased.
 Thus, changes in remittances that are not captured by the model are likely
 to lead to biased predictions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The magnitude and direction of the bias that arises due to OVB is often
 not clear and could compound other biases just as easily as it could be
 offset by other biases.
 Nevertheless, unless actual welfare data are available for the imputed
 year it is impossible to truly know how the model is performing.

Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paper has highlighted both the potential and the challenges of survey-to-su
rvey (S2S) imputation for poverty prediction, emphasizing the need for cautious
 application and robust methodological development.
 While S2S has several limitations, it may be the best available option
 in certain scenarios – particularly when real-time poverty estimates are
 needed, but household surveys are outdated, unavailable, or inconsistent,
 and when methods relying on real GDP growth are not feasible due to data
 limitations or reliability concerns.
 In some cases, S2S may offer more reliable estimates than alternatives
 such as extrapolations based purely on national accounts, which often diverge
 from household survey-based welfare measures.
 The question is not just whether S2S introduces bias, but how its biases
 compare to those of alternative methods – or the default of producing no
 estimate at all.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based on evidence from model-based simulations that reflect the method’s
 assumed data-generating process, the following recommendations emerge:
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Understand and Address Bias Sources:
\series default
 Practitioners should assess changes in error distributions and parameter
 instability, as these are key sources of prediction bias.
 This is especially critical during periods of economic transition.
 Fast-moving predictors should not be relied upon without thorough validation
 to mitigate omitted variable bias and other factors affecting the distribution
 of unobservables.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Enhance Validation Practices:
\series default
 Validation efforts should go beyond same-period tests and include cross-time
 validation to assess robustness against economic and structural changes.
 Practitioners should also evaluate predictions across multiple poverty
 thresholds to capture distributional nuances.
 Additionally, external validation – comparing results with broader indicators
 such as GDP and unemployment, while incorporating country-specific knowledge
 – enhances reliability.
 Good examples of these can be seen in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "sinha2022poverty"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 as well as 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "lain2022estimating"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 who rely on auxiliary data to lend further credence to their S2S estimates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Incorporate Structural and Temporal Dynamics:
\series default
 Methods that allow for time-varying parameters and account for structural
 changes in predictor-welfare relationships should be considered.
 For instance, shifting the constant term by observed growth between survey
 periods can help adjust for evolving dynamics.
 Combining multiple data sources can further improve the robustness and
 flexibility of predictions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Foster Transparency in Methodology and Communication: 
\series default
Practitioners must pursue clear and transparent reporting of assumptions,
 validation efforts, and uncertainties in S2S applications.
 Practitioners should thoroughly document how imputations are implemented—how
 errors and parameters are applied—and clearly communicate the limitations
 of the method, especially in contexts with high economic volatility.
 Uncertainty intervals should go beyond simple noise estimates and incorporate
 scenario analyses to contextualize findings for stakeholders.
 This may include sensitivity analyses that adjust key parameters to illustrate
 how results might shift under different assumptions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Exercise Caution in Interpretation:
\series default
 S2S methods should be applied with explicit acknowledgment of their limitations
, particularly for tracking poverty over long periods.
 Transparency is essential – clearly stating that the estimates are predicted
 rather than derived from an actual household survey ensures proper interpretati
on and avoids misrepresentation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Invest in Data and Research:
\series default
 Greater investment in regular, high-quality data collection is essential
 for reducing over-reliance on imputation methods and for improving the
 accuracy of poverty measurement.
 S2S methods ultimately depend on the quality and representativeness of
 the data they are built upon—weak or outdated data will naturally compromise
 the quality of imputed estimates.
 As the costs of data collection rise, there is a growing temptation to
 substitute imputation for new data.
 However, imputation should complement—not replace—regular survey programs.
 Sustained investment in data is necessary to ensure that models remain
 valid and are regularly recalibrated to reflect real-world changes.
 This point is also highlighted in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "fujii2020predicted"

\end_inset

, who caution against replacing genuine data with modelled estimates in
 contexts where underlying conditions are evolving.

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Support Survey Improvements While Maintaining Comparability
\series default
: Statistical Offices should be encouraged to update their surveys in line
 with best practices – for example, refining the measurement of housing
 and durable goods in consumption aggregates.
 However, such improvements can compromise comparability with earlier surveys.
 To address this, Statistical Offices could introduce "bridging" surveys
 by fielding the old questionnaire to a sub-sample of the new survey sample.
 This approach would allow them to assess key S2S assumptions, such as changes
 in the constant term of prediction models, helping to improve the reliability
 of imputed estimates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By recognizing both the challenges and the practical value of S2S, we can
 better position it as a useful tool for addressing poverty data gaps while
 maintaining the rigor needed for informed policy decisions.
 S2S should not be seen as an automatic substitute for household surveys
 but as a tool that – when carefully applied and validated – can provide
 meaningful insights when other data sources are unavailable or unreliable.
 The appropriate use of S2S is not just about improving estimates but also
 about demonstrating when cruder alternatives may be far more misleading.

The Case of Omitted Variable Bias
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Survey-to-survey imputation across time periods requires careful consideration.
 For example in a conflict setting, where conflict has significantly subsided
 between the collection of the training and the target data, it is crucial
 to control for conflict in the model.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Note that nothing to control for those shocks was included in the original
 model.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 In instances where conflict is not included in the model, its effects would
 only manifest through changes in other variables.
 This potential omitted variable bias raises concerns about the model's
 reliability for temporal predictions.
 When imputing over time, it is possible for multiple issues to arise.
 Since true expenditure is not available it is impossible to know if the
 model's biases cancel each other out or compound.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some may argue that the inclusion of fast changing consumption variables,
 such as an indicator of whether or not the household consumed eggs over
 the past week, are sufficient for accurate estimates of poverty .
 Nevertheless, these variables are likely subject to omitted variable bias
 which can lead to biased estimates of the coefficients leading to biased
 poverty measures.
 In the case of the imputation example given here, the omitted variable
 is conflict.
 In others it may be the introduction of a cash transfer or a global pandemic,
 for example.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assuming conflict is negatively related to expenditure and negatively related
 to consumption of certain goods, such as meat and eggs, this would lead
 to coefficients that are upward biased.
 Assume the following, simplified, model:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Y=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}Eggs+\beta_{2}Conflict+\varepsilon\label{eq:full_egg_conflict}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By omitting conflict the model is now:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Y=\tilde{\beta}_{0}+\tilde{\beta}_{1}Eggs+u\label{eq:fit_egg_conflict}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $u=\beta_{2}Conflict+\varepsilon$
\end_inset

.
 In a model where conflict is not included 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\beta}_{1}$
\end_inset

would be greater than 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 The OLS estimator for 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\beta}_{1}$
\end_inset

 is given by:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\tilde{\beta}_{1}=\frac{\mathrm{Cov}\left(Eggs,Y\right)}{\mathrm{Var}\left[Eggs\right]}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\tilde{\beta}_{1}=\frac{\mathrm{Cov}\left(Eggs,\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}Eggs+\beta_{2}Conflict+\varepsilon\right)}{\mathrm{Var}\left[Eggs\right]}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and relying on the linearity of covariance:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\tilde{\beta}_{1}=\beta_{1}+\frac{\beta_{2}\mathrm{Cov}\left(Eggs,Conflict\right)}{\mathrm{Var}\left[Eggs\right]}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since we assume that conflict and welfare are negatively correlated, and
 negatively correlated with the likelihood of buying eggs, then we know
 that 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{2}<0$
\end_inset

 and that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{Cov}\left(Eggs,Conflict\right)<0$
\end_inset

.
 This would lead to 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\beta_{2}\mathrm{Cov}\left(Eggs,Conflict\right)}{\mathrm{Var}\left[Eggs\right]}>0$
\end_inset

 which means that 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\beta}_{1}$
\end_inset

 is upward biased.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, the intercept will be underestimated.
 The intercept is equal to:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\tilde{\beta}_{0}=\bar{y}-\tilde{\beta}_{1}\overline{Eggs}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\[
\tilde{\beta}_{0}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}\overline{Eggs}+\beta_{2}\overline{Conflict}-\tilde{\beta}_{1}\overline{Eggs}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\tilde{\beta}_{0}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{2}\overline{Conflict}+(\beta_{1}-\tilde{\beta}_{1})\overline{Eggs}\label{eq:intercept}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
we know that 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{2}<0,$
\end_inset

 and that 
\begin_inset Formula $(\beta_{1}-\tilde{\beta}_{1})<0.$
\end_inset

 This suggests that the intercept term is downward biased.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When predicting over time, the direction of the prediction bias is dictated
 by changes in conflict and the share of households who purchased eggs.
 Any change in conflict, will lead to a change in egg purchases and expenditure.
 The direction of the bias in prediction is undetermined:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E\left[\bar{\tilde{y}}-\bar{y}\right]=E\left[\tilde{\beta}_{0}+\tilde{\beta}_{1}\overline{Eggs}'-\beta_{0}-\beta_{1}\overline{Eggs}'-\beta_{2}\overline{Conflict'}\right]

and downward biased if:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and while they could cancel eachother out, it is unlikely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that since poverty also depends on the model's predicted root mean
 squared error (
\begin_inset Formula $RMSE$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\sigma}$
\end_inset

), which would change over time since it is a function of the omitted variable
 – conflict – then there are 2 sources of bias.
 The first is due to the egg coefficient and the intercept, and the second
 is due to the difference in the distribution of errors which changes due
 to the omitted variable.
 A decrease in conflict would potentially lead to a shrinking of the 
\begin_inset Formula $RMSE$

, lowering the poverty likelihood of households but would be ignored in

, distributed across 
\begin_inset Formula $A=40$
\end_inset

 areas 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(a=1,\ldots,A\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Within each area 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

, observations are uniformly allocated over 
\begin_inset Formula $c=10$
\end_inset

 clusters 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(c_{a}=1,\ldots,C_{a}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Each cluster 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 consists of 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{ac}=50$
\end_inset

 observations and each area consists of 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{a}=500$
\end_inset

 observations.

\begin_layout Standard
Random effects are generated as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Cluster effects are simulated as 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{ac}\stackrel{iid}{\sim}N\left(0,0.1\right)$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{a}\stackrel{iid}{\sim}N\left(0,0.15^{2}\right)$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Household specific residuals as 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{aci}\overset{iid}{{\sim}}N\left(0,0.5^{2}\right)$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $c=1,\ldots,C_{a}$

\begin_layout Standard
For each of the 1,000 simulated populations, a two-stage sampling process
 is used to draw the source sample (used to train the model):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In the first stage, 4 clusters are selected at random (without replacement)
 within each area.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In the second stage, 10 observations are randomly selected from each selected
 cluster.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This results in a sample of 1,600 observations per population.
 The target data is drawn using the same sampling procedure, so the target
 sample may include entirely different clusters and observations than the
 source sample.
