Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sporadic household survey collection has been a thorn on the side of those
 monitoring global poverty long before the COVID-19 pandemic.
 As 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

 note, countries where poverty is mostly concentrated are the countries
 where there are long lapses between household survey collection efforts.
 For example, household survey data for monitoring welfare has not been
 made publicly available in India since 2011.
 In Nigeria, there was a lack of household survey data for poverty monitoring
 between 2009 and 2018.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Collecting household survey data that can be used for welfare monitoring
 is not a simple task.
 As noted by Yoshida et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeyearpar
key "SwiftMethod"

\end_inset

 it is a long and costly endeavor.
 Beyond just the costs incurred for the design of the survey instrument,
 the collection of household consumption is also a burden on households
 since consumption diaries must be filled every day for all household members,
 or a recall survey is necessary to measure household consumption.
 These modules are often lengthy and depending on which is chosen, can lead
 to different types of bias (

\begin_layout Standard
Household survey efforts across the globe during the COVID 19 Pandemic were
 completely halted.
 Household surveys are crucial for the monitoring of living conditions and
 during one of the greatest health and economic shocks the world was left
 in the dark about the impact on poverty of the pandemic.
 Given the lack of survey data which collected information necessary for
 the construction of welfare aggregates needed to monitor global poverty
 international organizations had to resort to alternate methods for estimating
 poverty.
 One of those methods, survey to survey imputation, was heavily used in
 conjunction with high frequency phone surveys to obtain an estimate of
 poverty during the pandemic in countries were HFPS were conducted.

 Global projections of poverty rely on GDP projections during the pandemic.
 The GDP projection for each country is used to shift the welfare distribution
 of a given country by the GDP per capita growth rate observed between year
 corresponding to the household survey collection and the desired year in
 the future.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Survey-to-survey imputation methods are a common approach to address the
 lack of a survey-based measurement of poverty.
 The basics behind the method build upon the poverty mapping approach introduced
 by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "jesko1998"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and then further refined by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "elbers2003micro"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The method relies on obtaining the joint distribution between expenditure
 and household and individual characteristics, and applying the estimated
 parameters of that distribution to those same household and individual
 characteristics in a different dataset.
 In the case of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "elbers2003micro"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 the different dataset was the census which allowed estimating poverty for
 small areas.
 In survey-to-survey imputation the approach is implemented from one sample
 to another sample where, for any number of reasons, welfare is not adequate
 for poverty monitoring or is entirely absent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both,

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 lay out the preconditions required for survey-to-survey imputation to work.
 Mainly that the characteristics used to predict welfare must be present
 in both datasets and correspond to a similar period since the variables
 should have similar distributions.
 Deviations, from these preconditions can result in severely biased poverty
 estimates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paper explores how ignoring the basic tenets underlying survey-to-survey
 imputation may lead to considerably biased estimates.
 Most papers where survey-to-survey imputation is discussed place a considerable
 focus on the variables selected for the method to work.
 That is ignored here.
 The goal here is to illustrate that survey-to-survey imputation over long
 periods of time is a futile attempt.
 To illustrate this, the paper relies on simulated data since it is easier
 to manipulate and determine what may be driving the observed results.
 Two main findings are presented; i) in the face of very different data,
 reweighting so that the means of the covariates match those of population
 will still yield biased estimates, and ii) survey-to-survey imputation
 will mostly replicate the welfare distribution of the survey used to construct
 the model and thus is unlikely to yield useful information on inequality.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The results here are of relevance since survey-to-survey imputation has
 become more prevalent in recent times to overcome data scarcity.
 One example is the multiple applications in India, where survey data useful
 for global poverty monitoring have not been released since 2011.
 India's importance in global poverty measurement cannot be overstated.
 Its large population implies that even a slight shift in poverty in the
 country can make or break the World Bank's pledge on ending extreme poverty.
 Consequently, since 2011 there are at least 3 different studies which attempt
 to estimate a poverty rate for the country making use of survey-to-survey
 imputation (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "newhouse2019estimating,sinha2022poverty,edochie2022we"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 These papers obtain a welfare model constructed on the 2011 data and apply
 it to several more recent data which lack a welfare measure to obtain poverty
 predictions.
 These survey-to-survey applications may provide a false sense of certainty
 on poverty where data does not exist.

\begin_layout Section
The basics behind survey to survey imputation (S2S)
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec:The-basics-behind"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Survey to survey (S2S) imputation for poverty measurement relies on the
 assumption that a population's welfare distribution can be captured by
 a linear model.
 Hence, the assumed data generating process (DGP) for transformed welfare
 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln y_{i}$
\end_inset

 is: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\ln\,y_{i}=x_{i}\beta+e_{i};\:e_{i}\sim N(0,\sigma_{e}^{2})\label{eq:welfare model}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many consideration one must take into account when doing S2S over
 time, mostly because when doing S2S there is a considerable share of the
 variation of welfare that is unexplained, 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 The distribution of the unexplained/unobserved portion of welfare must
 be estimated using actual data.
 Hence, the portion of the welfare distribution that is unobserved will
 always correspond to the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\sigma}_{e}^{2}$
\end_inset

 estimated using the survey where welfare is present.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In essence, we are decomposing the variance of 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln\,y_{i}$
\end_inset

, into an explainable component, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{xb}^{2}$
\end_inset

, and a random component, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{e}^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, what the often used 
\begin_inset Formula $R^{2}$
\end_inset

 reflects is the share of the variance of the dependent variable that is
 explained by the model and is equal to: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
R^{2}=\hat{\sigma}_{xb}^{2}/(\hat{\sigma}_{xb}^{2}+\hat{\sigma}_{e}^{2})
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When imputing across time, we lack information on the true unobservable
 component, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{e}^{2}$
\end_inset

 and must rely on the estimated one that comes from a different point in
 time, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\sigma}_{e}^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 What this means is that when imputing across time, households with the
 same observable characteristics will have the same probability of being
 poor in the imputed data as in the observed data.
 When doing S2S across surveys conducted in the same period and corresponding
 to the same population, this is a desirable feature, but when imputing
 across time, this is a stronger assumption which is unlikely to hold.
 Consequently, over time the model is not only assumed to hold (meaning
 that the characteristics used to model welfare will remain the same), but
 that unobservable factors will affect households equally over time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because we assume normally distributed data, for any given household, 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

, the probability of being poor is entirely dependent on its expected welfare,
 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}\hat{β},$
\end_inset

 and its error, 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{i}$
\end_inset

, which is assumed to follow 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{i}\sim N(0,σ_{e}^{2})$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
FGT_{0i}=Φ\,(\frac{\ln z-x_{i}\hat{β}}{\hat{σ}{}_{e}^{2}})
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln z$
\end_inset

 is the natural log of the poverty line, and 
\begin_inset Formula $Φ$
\end_inset

 is the standard normal distribution.
 Note that when imputing across time, the error is assumed to have the same
 distribution as the one estimated from the original survey where the model
 is fit, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{σ}{}_{e}^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, households with similar 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}\hat{β}$
\end_inset

 over time will have the same probability of being poor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the population, differences in poverty between the original survey and
 the imputed survey (
\begin_inset Formula $new$
\end_inset

) will be entirely dependent on the composition of the population and the
 distribution of the linear fit, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{σ}_{xbnew}^{2}$
\end_inset

, and the imputed mean transformed welfare which will be given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{X}_{new}\hat{\beta}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{X}_{new}$
\end_inset

 is a matrix of characteristic means for the population of the target survey.
 Consequently, for the population, poverty is given by: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
FGT_{0}=Φ\,(\frac{\ln z-\bar{X}_{new}\hat{\beta}}{\hat{\sigma}_{xbnew}^{2}+\hat{\sigma}_{e}^{2}})
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assuming that the original model (Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:welfare model"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) assumptions hold, then differences in poverty between the original welfare
 and the imputed welfare will be due to changes in the population's characterist
ics.
 Thus, it will still be considerably dependent on the past 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{σ}{}_{e}^{2}$
\end_inset

, but now the 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{σ}{}_{xbNEW}^{2}$
\end_inset

 also plays a role.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Differences between 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{σ}{}_{xbNEW}^{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{σ}{}_{xb}^{2}$
\end_inset

 may be due to several reasons, for example 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{σ}{}_{xbNEW}^{2}$
\end_inset

 could be smaller if poorer households catch up in education to richer household
s.
 The difference may also be due to differences in sampling discrepancies;
 for example, if the survey where we are imputing to has an over sample
 of richer households, this may be an issue as it could inflate 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{X}_{new}\hat{\beta}$
\end_inset

 and also yield a different 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{σ}{}_{xbnew}^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 For example, if the target survey yields an upward estimate of TV ownership
 (used in the model) and TV ownership is related to higher welfare values,
 then all else equal, this would yield a higher value for 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{X}_{NEW}\hat{\beta},$
\end_inset

which will yield a different poverty rate.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, the same issues affecting poverty will affect Gini when imputing
 across time.
 Assuming that welfare is lognormally distributed then Gini is equal to
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "crow1987lognormal"
literal "false"

\end_inset

): 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Gini=2Φ(\frac{σ}{\sqrt{2}})-1
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $σ$
\end_inset

 is the standard deviation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln y$
\end_inset

.
 Consequently, the imputed Gini across time is also dependent on 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{σ}{}_{e}^{2}$
\end_inset

, which is estimated in an older survey since 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
σ^{2}=\hat{\sigma}{}_{xbNEW}^{2}+\hat{\sigma}{}_{e}^{2}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and consequently, also subject to changes in the sample’s distribution of
 the observed characteristics used in the model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because under most good modeling scenarios the model’s 
\begin_inset Formula $R^{2}$
\end_inset

 ranges from 0.40 to 0.60, the unexplained portion 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\sigma}_{e}^{2}$
\end_inset

 may be quite considerable.
 Note that differences between 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{σ}{}_{e}^{2}$
\end_inset

, which could be estimated using data from a different point in time, and
 actual unobserved distributional changes could be due to observable factors
 which may now matter for welfare in the imputed years.
 For example, the introduction of a cash transfer program, which is not
 captured in the original model.
 Or due to other types of shock, for example, currency demonetization.

Survey to survey imputation a brief overview

 work of

 The authors focus on obtaining poverty estimates for smaller localities

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The authors rely on covariates which are readily found in the household
 survey as well as in the population census.
 The estimated parameters are applied to the country's census data which
 covers the entire country but lacks a welfare measure which is apt for
 poverty measurement.
 With model parameters in hand it is possible to recreate in the census
 population the welfare distribution observed in the survey.
 From the imputed welfare distribution it is possible to then obtain estimates
 of any indicator as if one had the actual welfare distribution available.
 For an indicator such as headcount poverty, being able to replicate the
 welfare distribution accurately is essential to ensure unbiased estimates
 as noted by Corral et al.
 (2022).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are basic preconditions required for survey to survey imputation to
 work.
 The most basic one is that the covariates used in both datasets must correspond
 to the same population.
 This means that the distribution of these covariates must have similar
 moments, e.g.
 mean and variance.
 Differences between covariates across datasets can lead to biased estimates.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The methodology of survey to survey imputation where actual welfare data
 are unavailable has gained a bit of prominence within the World Bank.
 A good example is the Survey of Well-being via Instant and Frequent Tracking
 (SWIFT) program.
 In essence the program relies on survey to survey imputation where a small
 and cost effective sample of data are collected in the field and poverty
 estimates for the collected data are obtained by imputation.
 SWIFT has also been used to obtain poverty estimates in a survey which
 has been collected much more recently than the one used for the modeling,
 which has led to incorrect poverty estimates.
 Such an example is that of Afghanistan in 2015, where the model was trained
 on 2011 data and failed to capture an increase in headcount poverty.
 As an answer to this instance the SWIFT program added variables which change
 along economic conditions.
 However, the program notes that without updating the training data where
 the model parameters are estimated there is always a risk of not properly
 capturing changes in the face of economic shocks (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because survey to survey imputation may yield biased estimates when the
 data used to obtain parameter estimates and the data imputed to are very
 different, multiple recommendations on addressing the differences have
 been made.
 For example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "stifel2007tracking"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 note the estimated parameters are assumed stationary over time and that
 inclusion of key time varying variables such as rainfall and prices are
 important and may allow to capture changes over time.
 However, the authors also indicate that predictions too far in the future
 or in the past should be avoided, mostly due to the restrictiveness of
 the stationary parameter assumption.
 In essence, the stationary assumption implies that any changes in poverty
 captured over time are entirely attributable to changes in covariates used
 in the model and not due to changes in unobservables or rates of return
 to the covariates used (Dang, Lanjouw and Serajuddin 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

).
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 note that in fast growing economies, like India, the stationary assumption
 may be controversial.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bias of estimates obtained with data that correspond to very different
 time periods or data where the covariates are considerably different has
 mostly been studied using real world data.
 For example, Dang, Lanjouw and Serajuddin (

 The authors validate their approach using data for Vietnam and for China
 using a rural household panel dataset.
 In Vietnam, the authors obtain a model using the 1992/93 data and predict
 poverty using the 1997/98 data.
 They note that the method works relatively well and depending on the covariates
 used, differences between predicted and observed poverty rates were on
 average 3.4 percentage points during a period where poverty fell by 23.2
 percentage points.
 For the Chinese regions where the method was tested, the authors also find
 that the methods work relatively well.
 However, depending on the model used differences between predicted and
 observed rates were considerable.

\begin_layout Subsection
The Case of India
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Applications of survey to survey imputation have also made their way to
 global poverty monitoring.
 This is mostly due to India's lack of recent survey data.
 The last expenditure survey published by the National Sample Survey agency
 of India dates back to 2011.
 Since then, official poverty estimates have been lacking.
 In 2017, when the next expenditure survey for the country was supposed
 to be released it was scrapped due to concerns regarding its validity.
 There were leaks of the report, however, and these suggested that between
 2011 and 2017/18 consumption in the country had fallen by 3.7 percent.

 While rural consumption fell by 8.8 percent, urban areas fared somewhat
 better and grew by 2 percent over the period.
 Given the lack of actual data to validate the leaked report there have
 been multiple attempts to obtain a prediction for headcount poverty in
 the country (see

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 In that study the authors find that in 2017 the share of Indians who live
 on less than $1.90 (USD PPP) per person per day is 9.9 percent.
 The drop in poverty between 2011 and 2017 (22.5% to 9.9%) is in sharp contrast
 to the leaked results from the 2017 leaked report from India's NSO which
 suggested poverty had increased in the country.
 The authors rely on model parameters estimated using the 2011 data and
 apply these to the 2017/18 Survey on Social Consumption (SCS) on Health.
 The SCS is a nationally representative survey and thus the authors' concern
 is mostly centered on imputing across time and recognize that they assume
 parameters remain constant over time.
 Consequently, the authors assume that the entire change is explained by
 the changes in covariates.
 The authors corroborate their results by using a pass-through approach
 to obtain a projected poverty rate of 10.4 percent.

 The adjusted weights are obtained via a minimum-cross entropy procedure
 which uses the weighted means of the target variables between the CPHS

 The authors find that in 2019 the share of Indians who live on less than
 $1.90 (USD PPP) per person per day is 12.3 percentage points lower than in
 2011 where the poverty rate stood at 22.5 percent.

The Case of Afghanistan

\begin_layout Standard
Afghanistan's poverty estimates for 2023 rely on a survey-to-survey imputation
 model 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "barriga2023updating"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This model uses an expenditure model estimated on the third quarter of
 the 2019-2020 Expenditure and Labor Force Survey (IE-LFS), which measured
 the national poverty rate at 52.3 percent.
 The imputed poverty rate for the corresponding period in 2023 stands at
 48.3 percent, indicating a 4-percentage-point drop.
 The authors state that this national trend masks important regional differences
: urban poverty rates slightly increased, while a decrease in rural areas
 offset this rise and contributed to the overall decline.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nevertheless, the country's economy during that period faced considerable
 challenges.
 Between 2019 and 2023, Afghanistan experienced a significant GDP contraction,
 particularly following the change in administration and the departure of
 the U.S.
 Armed Forces.
 According to the country's Macro-Poverty Outlook for the 2023 annual meetings,
 this GDP drop coincided with falling food prices, leading to increased
 labor force participation and a doubling of unemployment.
 Agricultural households—predominantly in rural areas—were likely the most
 affected by these lower prices.
 Yet, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "barriga2023updating"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 suggest that the overall poverty reduction is driven by declines in rural
 poverty, possibly indicating that falling prices might offset income losses
 in these areas.
 However, this interpretation is speculative, as it is not explicitly modeled
 or thoroughly discussed by the authors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

 argue that much of the observed welfare changes stem from dummy variables
 capturing consumption patterns, such as the presence or absence of specific
 goods like apples.
 Their model test results (Table 4) show that imputed estimates using the
 same data as the one used for the model yielded an estimate that was nearly
 1 percentage point off the real value.
 The model when applied to data for 2021, was already giving estimates that
 were 1.7 percentage points above actual urban values and 2.1 points above
 rural values, suggesting that a 4-point margin of error for 2023 is plausible.
 Given the economic indicators suggesting worsening conditions, the reported
 4-percentage-point poverty drop seems questionable.
 While reduced conflict might partially explain this trend, such factors
 are not included in the model and remain speculative narratives rather
 than data-driven conclusions.

The Case of Zambia
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Zambia had a gap in survey data between 2015 and 2022.
 Nevertheless, the 2022 consumption data is not comparable to the 2015 consumpti
on data.
 The reason for the lack of comparability is that the food module in 2022
 uses a different recall period than the 2015 survey.
 The 2015 survey relied on a fixed recall period, whereas the 2022 survey
 only used a fixed recall period when inquiring if the household consumed
 the good over that period.
 Nevertheless, respondents in 2022 were allowed to select a different reference
 period when providing information on quantities and value of their consumption.
 The difference in reporting periods leads to a lack of comparability in
 the data, which compromises the construction of a poverty trend 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "beegle2012methods"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To solve the lack of comparability, the Zambia team relied on survey-to-survey
 methods to impute the 2015 welfare aggregate on the 2022 data.
 Through that approach, the team finds that international poverty ($2.15
 2017 USD PPP) in the country worsened between 2015 and 2022 by close to
 4 percentage points, from 60.8 to 64.4 percent.
 At the same time the team reports a drop in inequality, measured by the
 Gini index, from 55.9 to 51.5.
 Average consumption is also reported to have declined during the period,
 from $2.97 (2017 PPP) to $2.53 (2017 PPP), a 15 percent drop in consumption.
 All these indicators, except for inequality, point towards a worsening
 situation in Zambia.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite the negative story from the imputations, the macro story is not
 as negative.
 The country’s GDP per capita between 2015 and 2022 is relatively the same.
 After a considerable drop during the COVID-19 pandemic, GDP per capita
 in constant terms reached its 2015 levels by 2022, and by 2023 it is above
 its peak in 2018.
 Hence, the imputed consumption aggregate suggests that there has been an
 increase in the gap between national accounts data and household survey
 data which is not explained.
 One of the suggested reasons for the gap between national accounts and
 household surveys has been under reporting of incomes in surveys

The comparable components of expenditure correspond to 33.7 percent of the
 2015 survey expenditure, but does not include food, and frequent non-food
 components.
 The comparable component consists mainly of health, a sub-set of education,
 clothing, financial services, durables, and housing.
 The last item, housing, corresponds to imputed rent.
 In urban areas, the comparable component suggests consumption has decreased
 in real terms.
 In rural areas there is no discernible change.
 The authors validate their results applying a method from Deaton (2003)
 that relies on a comparable subset of the welfare aggregate nad is aligned
 to that based on the imputation model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The authors also validate their model by imputing on the same data as the
 one used for the model.
 Their validations already point toward a slighupward bias in their model
 for urban areas, same for their Gini predictions, both likely driven by
 the residuals not meeting the model's assumptions (Table 6).
 There are concerns with the approach taken in this imputation exercise.
 First, the models fit have a surprisingly high 
\begin_inset Formula $R^{2}$
\end_inset

 value – 0.8 for rural, and 0.91 for urban areas.
 Such a high 
\begin_inset Formula $R^{2}$
\end_inset

 value may be suggestive of overfitting.
 The rural model includes as a covariate the natural logarithm of comparable
 reat consumption per addult equivalent, and its square – the coefficients
 for both are positive.

 The rural model also includes number of items purchased in logarithms,
 where presumably

 Finally, the model likely includes many covariates that are potentially

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model for urban areas has an 
\begin_inset Formula $R^{2}$
\end_inset

 value of 0.91, one of the higre values obsevred in such an exercise.
 The model includes the number of inactive household members, which a priori
 one would expect is negatively related to consumption, but is positive
 in this case.
 Moreover, the model suggests that between 2015 and 2022 the number of inactive
 members increased by nearly 1 person, from 1.6 to 2.4.
 Beyond the issue of the inactive members, the urban and rural models share
 many of the same limitations.
 Mainly, the high 
\begin_inset Formula $R^{2}$
\end_inset

is suggestive of overfitting that would limit its predictive out-of-sample
 capacity, particularly when applying the model to data that is 7 years
 ahead.

Imputing to the Same Population
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The section first looks at imputations to the same population - those that
 correspond to the same period.
 For example, you have a living standards survey and a contemporaneous Demograph
ic and Health Survey (DHS).
 In this case, imputing welfare to the DHS can be used to determine the
 incidence of stunting or some other health indicator across the welfare
 distribution.
 In essence, the assumption is that the living standards survey and the
 DHS are samples of the same population.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The section first details how populations for the simulations shown are
 created.
 Since it is possible for a sample to be biased, biased samples are also
 created.
 The section first explores how imputation from a model fit to a sample
 of the population works when imputing to a separate sample of the same
 population.
 The section then explores how imputing to a biased sample may affect prediction
s and how one may overcome biased samples for poverty imputation.

 for the case of India where there were concerns regarding the sampling

 Although referred to by the authors as a max-entropy approach, the method
 used to adjust the target sample weights is in reality minimum cross-entropy
 where the sampling weights in the target survey are adjusted by the smallest
 extent possible given the constraints (

Adjusting for potential bias in the sample through standardizing covariates
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The basics of the method is simple.
 In principle, from the data where the model is fit (source data) the mean
 and variance of each covariate is known.
 Consequently, covariates in the sample to be imputed (target data) can
 be adjusted so that the mean and variance of the covariates are aligned
 to that of the source data.
 This is what 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

 recommend for making different survey samples more comparable.
 However, a key assumption here is that the covariates follow a normal distribut
ion.
 In tests done by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 with data from Jordan the method is judged to be valid.

 Note, however, that the covariates here do not follow a normal distribution.
 Covariate standardization is done by adjusting the covariate from the

Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To remove the potential for other sources of bias, instead of refitting
 a model on the sample, the actual values for the coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 and the error distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{e}^{2}$
\end_inset

 are used.
 For each sample, under each population, 100 vectors in the sample are created
 by adding the linear fit to a randomly drawn error term 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{i}\sim N(0,0.5^{2})$
\end_inset

 to every observation; note that the linear fit is kept fixed.
 Then, poverty and Gini estimates are obtained for each of the 100 created
 vectors using the newly created survey weights or the standardized covariates
 to calculate poverty and Gini for the samples.
 The average value of the 100 Gini and poverty estimates is used as the
 final estimate.
 Bias is calculated for each measure of interest by comparing the estimate
 with the actual value from the population.
 Results are presented in Table

Poverty estimates under the biased samples are downward biased.
 The bias is more considerable for the top and bottom biased samples.
 Additionally, the bias for 
\begin_inset Formula $FGT0$
\end_inset

 is lower for low thresholds and increases before falling again for higher
 thresholds.
 The direction of the bias would eventually change as the distributions
 cross paths.
 Thus, the size and direction of the bias are dependent on the threshold
 chosen.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The results show that standardizing covariates as suggested by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "dang2017"

\end_inset

 is a better approach than reweighting covariates, of course this result
 may not hold under different covariates.
 However, even better results are obtained by standardizing the linear fit
 (
\begin_inset Formula $X\beta)$
\end_inset

.
 Standardizing 
\begin_inset Formula $X\beta$
\end_inset

 yields phenomenal results under both biased samples tested.
 Given that the standardizing relies on normally distributed data, perhaps
 a better option is achieved from reweighting.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Results presented in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Bias-(x100)-due"

 suggest that not all types of reweighting work well.
 Re-weighting to match means, as done in an application in India by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "sinha2022poverty"

\end_inset

, rows Covariate mean match (x100)).
 Since the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{e}^{2}$
\end_inset

 used are always the true values, one can surmise that the bias from the
 sampling cannot be overcome by simply reweighting the data.
 This also holds true for cases where the weights are adjusted so that the
 linear fit in the biased sample matches the mean of the SRS data.
 This introduced bias will be in addition to any other potential sources
 of bias, for example, non-normally distributed residuals or using a 
\begin_inset Formula $σ_{e}$
\end_inset

 that does not correspond to the same period.
 The bias is in addition to all the other potential sources of bias of the
 imputation, such as deviation from the model’s assumptions or assuming
 that the distribution of unobservables is the same as it was in a different
 period.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Adjusting weights so that the linear fit (
\begin_inset Formula $X\beta)$
\end_inset

 and its variance in the biased sample matches that of the SRS yields excellent
 results which rival those from standardizing 
\begin_inset Formula $X\beta$
\end_inset

 for bottom biased samples and supersedes them in the top & bottom biased
 sample.
 The added advantage with the reweighting is that there are limited assumptions
 imposed on the distribution of the linear fit.

\begin_layout Standard
For Gini, a similar issue is at play.
 Because biasing a sample by excluding households at the bottom of the distribut
ion will likely lead to lower 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{var}[xβ]$
\end_inset

, which is not addressed by the re-weighting procedure used,
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\noindent
Note that under the minimum cross entropy procedure chosen it would be possible
 to set the variance as one of the constraints.
 However, this is not implemented here because in practice 
\begin_inset Formula $var[xβ]$
\end_inset

 for a given point in time, is not known.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 keeping everything else equal leads to a downward biased estimate of Gini.
 This is worse under the top and bottom biased samples because the value
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $var[xβ]$
\end_inset

 is considerably smaller than under the bottom biased sample.
 Consequently, adjusting the weights so that not just the mean of 
\begin_inset Formula $X\beta$
\end_inset

 matches the value observed in the SRS but also 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{var}[xβ]$
\end_inset

 yields much better imputed values for Gini.

\begin_layout Subsection
Imputation over time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A key assumption when imputing across time is that the parameters are constant
 over time.
 This means that the relationship between the covariates and the dependent
 variable remain constant and that the distribution of the unobservables
 remain constant.
 In essence, the assumption is that any change in the welfare distribution
 will be entirely driven by changes in the covariates.
 Nevertheless, under variaous early work of S2S the common recommendation
 was to rely on covariates that are relatively stable and do not change
 (
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 Recommending the use of covariates that show minimal change is contradictory
 to the previous statement if the goal is to capture changes in poverty.
 In this section the discussion focuses on how changes in the parameters
 can affect the poverty predictions.
 In practice, it is possible that any of the parameters used for the imputation
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\beta,\:\sigma\right)$
\end_inset

 has changed over time, however it is impossible to know if changes compound
 or cancel eachother.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Changes in the Residual's Distribution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First note that it is possible, although unlikely, for the relationship
 between covariates and the dependent variable to be constant over time
 and there to be a change in poverty.
 The change can be driven entirely by changes in the unobservables.
 Changes in the unobservables also implies a change in inequality.
 To illustrate this, the same population created in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Creating-populations"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 is used.
 The simulation consists in keeping the linear fit constant and only change
 the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{e}$
\end_inset

.
 Results are presented in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Change-in-poverty_sigma"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, and illustrate how poverty rates change under different lines determined
 at the percentile of the original welfare.
 Hence, if the original poverty rate was 25 percent, and using that same
 threshold when lowering the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{e}$
\end_inset

 by 25 percent, the resulting poverty rate would be of 22.3 percent.
 At higher threholds the gap between the original poverty rate and the new
 rates is less noticeable, although still present.

\begin_layout Subsection
Changes in the Constant Term
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When conducting imputations over time, changes to the constant term are
 seldomly considered.
 Failing to capture a change in the constant term can lead to relatively
 stagnant predictions over time.
 It will also lead to predictions that are considerably off.
 In Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Change-in-poverty_intercept"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 the true constant term is adjusted by 
\begin_inset Formula $x\%$
\end_inset

 in the data generating process for the target data.
 Even slight changes lead to considerable differences in poverty.
 Imagine an unlikely scenario where transformed welfare for everyone has
 increased by 
\begin_inset Formula $5\%$
\end_inset

, yet everything else about the welfare distribution remains the same.
 This would entail a neutral distribution shift to the right, and thus everyone'
s transformed welfare is improved by 5%.
 However, relying on a model fit on data before the increase would predict
 a constant term that is lower than what it really is after the increase
 in welfare.
 This would lead to imputations that considerably overestimate poverty for
 the new period.

 The colors represent percentiles at which poverty thresholds were determined
 under the source data.
 Thus, if true welfare shifted neutrally to the right by 5 percent and the
 imputation model fails to account for that, then poverty would be overestimated.
